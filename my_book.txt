Chairwoman MORELLA. I will call the joint hearing to order. I want to
welcome all of you to the joint hearing with the Basic Research
Subcommittee on the topic of Overcoming Barriers to the Utilization of
Technology in the Classroom.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.5.0}

Today\'s rapid advancement and technological development has opened us
all up to a new and exciting world that, just a few short years ago,
seemed unimaginable. With the click of a mouse, technology continues to
change the way we live, learn, work, and interact each and every day.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.6.0}

Perhaps, in no other area do we hope to benefit more from the influx of
technology in our society than in our Nation\'s educational system.
Successful integration of technology in our schools has the potential to
transform the way our children learn, creating new and challenging
opportunities to enhance their academic perform

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.7.0}

Students in today\'s connected classroom are no longer bound,
physically, by the bricks and mortar that surround them. Instead, they
have at their fingertips the opportunity to explore the world and take
in vast amounts of information along the way. We are only just beginning
to realize the potential of technology in helping to improve student
learning and increase academic performance.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.8.0}

And with new technologies being developed at lightening speed, we can
only imagine the promise it holds for the future. Yet, as we approach
the beginning of the 21st Century, many schools have been slow to
implement a technology-rich learning environment that is crucial for
tackling the challenges of the next millennium.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.9.0}

According to a recent report prepared by the CEO Forum on Education and
Technology, represented today by Mr. Spoon, only 6 percent of our
Nation\'s schools are at the leading edge or effectively integrating
technology into the classroom. More importantly, the report noted that
over half of our Nation\'s schools were considered

\"low technology" or having limited access, if any at all, to mostly
outdated computer equipment.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.1.0}

We know there are barriers that schools face in seeking to integrate
technology into their curriculum. The costs associated with developing
technology savvy in schools are significant. And schools must
increasingly weigh the benefits of investing in technology against other
competing priorities, such as school maintenance, construction, and the
hiring of new teachers.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.2.0}

To-date, the Federal Government has been heavily involved in helping
schools integrate technology into the classroom. The General Accounting
Office has estimated that at least 27 federal programs provide funding
that may be used to purchase, among other things, technologies for
schools and libraries.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.3.0}

Yet, despite this significant federal investment in educational
technology and the promise it holds for our youth, it is clear that
computers, alone, cannot improve our Nation\'s school systems. Used
incorrectly, technology can become a very expensive babysitter,
providing little benefit, while stripping schools and districts of
scarce resources.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.4.0}

I continue to believe that the classroom teacher is the key, the key to
bringing technology into our schools. Many educators simply do not have
the training necessary to successfully implement the use of technology
in their curriculum in a meaningful way.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.5.0}

And the CEO Forum on Education and Technology found that only 20 percent
of full-time public school teachers felt prepared to integrate
technology in a classroom; only 20 percent. To address the challenges
that schools face in implementing successful technology programs, last
February, I introduced H.R. 645, which is the Teacher Technology
Training Act.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.6.0}

And that legislation would require states to incorporate technology
requirements in teacher training and content standards. The bill also
encourages schools, districts to include technology classes in their
programs, and colleges and universities to incorporate technology into
their education curriculum. Now, our hearing today will explore the
appropriate role of technology in K-12 education.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.7.0}

We will look at the role of the Federal Government in helping schools
integrate technology into their classrooms in a meaningful way. And we
want to examine the barriers that schools face in implementing a
successful technology-rich learning environment, and what needs to be
done to help teachers and administrators overcome these obstacles.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.8.0}

Finally, we also need to talk about how the private sector can be
harnessed to assist schools in their technology programs. Large and
small businesses alike have a vested interest in ensuring students have
the skills they need to succeed in a workforce driven by the information
age. For unless we utilize classroom technology in a meaningful way, we
run the risk of graduating students who are really unprepared to succeed
in the 21st Century job market.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.9.0}

So, the private sector certainly has a role to play. We have a very
distinguished panel of witnesses today. And I do look forward to their
testimony. It is now-it gives me great pleasure to yield to the Chairman
of the Basic Research Subcommittee, Mr. Nick Smith, for his opening
comments.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.0.0}

Mr. SMITH. Well, I also would certainly like to welcome our panelists.
And I thank the Chair of the Technology Subcommittee, Representative
Morella, for organizing this hearing. The topic certainly is very
important as we look for overcoming

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.1.0}

barriers and assuring that the kind of technology that we can offer
today is constructive, in terms of the ultimate success of students in
their quest for learning.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.2.0}

Today\'s education technology offers students and teachers access to
astonishing amounts of information. And I would include in technology,
not only computer and the Web site, but our televisions through
satellite feeds. I noticed on my television, I can get three different
stations that totally dedicate themselves to motorcycles.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.3.0}

So here, again, an insurmountable amount of information, in terms of
motorcycles. It is three more locations from our satellites on
motorcycles that I use. But, again, just to point out how much
information is out there. And so somehow educators, like our panelists
today, need to start assessing how we can utilize so much information.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.4.0}

And what is the reasonable limits of having that information available
to kids? And what is the proper balance where we have that information,
as opposed to teaching these children and having these students learn
how to think[? ]{style="font-style:italic;"}

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.5.0}

That ultimately is going to be a greater benefit to themselves, their
families, and this Country. I would suggest that the Federal Government
puts a lot of money into this issue, literally hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. And we hope to ensure that these programs are effective,
both educationally effective and cost effective.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.6.0}

As most are aware, there have been concerns raised about how some
education technology initiatives, such as the ones involving the E-Rate
Tax, for example, have been funded and implemented, in terms of hooking
up these schools to the Internet. In terms of those schools that have
already taken the initiative of hooking up their schools to the
Internet, prior to the availability of this kind of money, have
sometimes been short-changed with this new program that government
offers with restrictive use for those particular funds.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.7.0}

I would hope the panel today could address one of my concerns about
technology in the classroom, a concern I think others share. Namely, are
these computers in the classroom helping our children learn to think?
And how do we make that decision?

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.8.0}

Two schools in my District, schools that are fairly close to each other
geographically, and serve very similar communities, take two totally
different approaches to computers in the classroom.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.9.0}

In one, computers are present in the school and available for students
to use, but only in designated computer labs. In the other school,
students have a series of computers in almost every classroom. And as I
walk to the back of some of these classrooms, students sometimes are
rapidly changing the programs that they might have on their computer
screens.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.10.0}

And so, again, the challenges. And what we would look to you today, as
expert witnesses, is the proper balance and the effective use of
computers, with information technology such a vital part of tomorrow\'s
education. And what I would ask, Madam Chairman, is the rest of my
remarks be inserted into the record. And maybe I

Chairwoman MORELLA. Without objection, so ordered.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.2.0}

Thank you for your opening statement, Mr. Chairman. I would now like to
recognize the Ranking Member of the Basic Research Subcommittee, Ms.
Eddie Bernice Johnson.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.3.0}

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairman, and Mr.
Chairperson of the Basic Research. I am pleased to join my colleagues in
welcoming our witnesses today to this joint hearing of the Technology
and Basic Research Subcommittees on technology in the classroom.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.4.0}

The promise of applications of new information technologies in the
schools is by now well known. Such possibilities as instruction tailored
to individual students, curriculum enriched through access to remote
educational resources, and to powerful new ways to visualize complex
information.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.5.0}

Knowledge of the most effective ways for using educational technology is
not yet available, nor in general have the effects on student
performance been quantified for applications of a particular technology.
However, enough evidence has been obtained, particularly from
experiments involving technology-rich schools with welltrained and
highly-motivated teachers, to drive interest and expanding the access of
schools through information technology.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.6.0}

The introduction of educational technology involves two major sets of
issues. The first revolves around the acquisition and maintenance of
computers and networks. This sounds simple. The reality is that while
some schools have new computers, too often, these same schools lack the
technology staff necessary to keep these computers operational.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.7.0}

The second major set of issues is the integration of technology into
actual classroom instruction. For both, educators and administrators
need information about options and best practices, and direct
assistance, and teacher preparation and guidance in the use of
educational software.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.8.0}

Today, we will review what federal efforts may assist schools in using
educational technology. In particular, we will discuss some legislative
ideas that have been advanced by our colleagues that address specific
aspects of the acquisition and effective use of technology.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.9.0}

I believe that the Federal Government can be a catalyst for constructive
change in our schools, if it is, if its relatively small K12 education
investment is wisely directed. I look forward to hearing the views and
recommendations of our witnesses on strategies that could lead to more
effective deployment and use of educational technology.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.10.0}

And I want to thank the joint Chairs for holding today\'s hearing on
this important topic. I appreciate the attendance of our witnesses, and
look forward to the discussion. Thank you.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.11.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.12.0}

It gives me great pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of the
Technology Subcommittee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Jim Barcia.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.1.0}

Mr. BARCIA. Thank you, Chairwoman Morella.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.2.0}

I want to join you, and Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Johnson, and
the Committee members in welcoming the witnesses, and everyone in the
audience to today\'s hearing. Technology in the classroom is one of
those perennial topics, which we have discussed for the past 50 years.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.3.0}

Back in the 1950s, filmstrips and movies were met with great
anticipation, as a means to improve the educational experience. In the
1980s, computers were regularly being used as an educational tool. And
in this decade, the Internet has become the latest technology to improve
education.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.4.0}

While I believe we can all agree that these technology advances have
benefitted our students, in our zeal to put these technologies in a
classroom, we must also ensure that teachers, administrators, and
schools boards know how to best utilize their educational technology
investments. A February 1999 Department of Education Report, Teacher
Quality, a report on the preparation and qualification of public school
teachers, found that only 20 percent of teachers felt well-prepared to
work in modern classrooms. This was not a new finding. An Office of
Technology Assessment Report, Teachers and Technology: Making the
Connection, identified teacher training as the most critical, and
generally the most neglected element of edtech programs.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.5.0}

H.R. 2534, introduced by my colleague, Mr. Larson, is a required step in
developing the policies to ensure that all schools are linked to the
Internet. In addition to Mr. Larson\'s efforts, earlier this year, Mr.
Wu and myself, introduced H.R. 2417, the Educational Technology
Utilization Extension Assistance Act.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.6.0}

The goal of this legislation is simple: to improve the use of
educational technology in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms.
This bill creates Educational Technology Extension Centers to advise
K-12 teachers, administrators, and school boards on how to better
utilize their existing ed- tech investments, as well as providing advice
on new educational technology.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.7.0}

I look forward to hearing the witnesses comment about these Educational
Technology Centers, as outlined in H.R. 2417. While I believe that a
need exists for these Centers, I want to stress that a number of school
districts already provide this type of support. For example, in my
hometown of Bay City, Michigan, the Bay Aroneck Intermediate School
District provided professional training for nearly 1,000 educators last
year.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.8.0}

This type of support is critical in providing teachers with the skills
they need to integrate the latest technologies in their classrooms.
Legislation, like H.R. 2534, complements these ongoing efforts. In areas
where this type of technical advice is not available, H.R. 2417 would
begin this important effort.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.9.0}

Given our rapidly changing economy, and increasingly global economic
competition, we need to provide our children with the best education
possible. Education technology can both enhance the students\'
educational experience and provide them with valuable job skills. I
believe that both of these bills are a step in this
direction.[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.0.0}[ I want to thank our
panelists for appearing before the Subcommittees. I look forward to
hearing your comments, and also thank Chairwoman Morella, and the Chair
also, of course of the, Chairman Smith, excuse me, Nick, of the, yes, of

School boards across America are critically important. And I would
specifically direct it to Mr. Spoon to use the good offices of the great
Washington Post. And I would challenge editors, and publishers, and
people identified with such journals across the Nation to challenge
corporate America because here is what happens.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.5.0}

When I have a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, or the National
Association of Manufacturers, or any other business-oriented group, they
constantly tell me about the government spending too much money, about
State Governments, Federal Government spending too much money. I listen
to them politely. And then I usually ask them a couple of questions.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.6.0}

One, how many employees that you have are on school boards back in their
local communities? Then I usually ask them, how many of your
corporations have a day care policy? And the reason I do that is because
if the business community does not take a greater role in providing
inspired leadership, starting at the local level, there is going to be a
big void. And there is, in this instance, in terms of getting into the
21st Century with technology training.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.7.0}

And if we want things to operate in a more professional businesslike
way, we have got to have more professional business people involved in
the decision-making starting at the local level. So, I would hope you
would take this on advisement and give some consideration.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.8.0}

I would like to know, from the Fortune 500 companies, how many employees
of their respective companies are on school boards, because they know
how important this subject matter is? And the answer is too few. So, I
think there is a great opportunity for you and others so situated to
help in the cause. Thank you, Madam Chair.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.9.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. I think the Subcommittees would both agree with you,
Mr. Boehlert. I am now pleased to recognize Mr. Larson from Connecticut,
who is one of the motivators for this joint hearing. Mr. Larson.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.10.0}

Mr. LARSON. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.11.0}

Let me thank my esteemed colleagues and distinguished witnesses for
being here. And I want to, again, thank Chairwoman Morella and Chairman
Smith, Ranking Members Barcia and Johnson for holding this hearing on
this very timely topic before us

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.0.0}

today. And I would request at the outset that the extent of my remarks
be inserted in the record, and will briefly summarize.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.1.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Without objection, so ordered.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.2.0}

Mr. LARSON. The Department of Commerce came out with a report in July
9th of this year entitled Falling Through the Net. And it very
dramatically talked about the digital divide that is being created in
this country. The digital divide is happening along the lines of race,
gender, geographic location, and wealth.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.3.0}

And what they noted is that the problem is getting worse. And it is not
just a question of computers in the classroom. It is a question of the
total integration of voice, video, and data information, and how to best
utilize that. That creates a problem for a number of our public school
systems, because clearly, at least in my humble estimation, that is
where we have to resolve this specific issue.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.4.0}

And to do so, as was pointed out by Nick Smith, we have to address it on
several levels, one of which is teach training. And Chairwoman Morella
and Representative Stabenow have put together bills that I think are
vitally important and that I am a cosponsor of.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.5.0}

But also along the lines of teacher training, we have to address a basic
infrastructure concern from a technological standpoint. And that
infrastructure concern is how do we provide universal, ubiquitous
service so that all students have access to the information super
highway?

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.6.0}

And how do we come up with a means that is the most effective, and the
most efficient means of providing voice, video, and data communication
within the context of our schools, and that our teachers can utilize in
their daily lesson plans, and in their curriculums.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.7.0}

I am looking forward to the testimony here today. And I am delighted,
Madam Chairwoman, to have with us a dear friend, and an individual who I
have long been an admirer of, Dr. James Fallon, from East Hartford,
Connecticut, who is the Superintendent of Schools there.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.8.0}

And just very briefly, if I might, Madam Chairwoman, by way of going
forward. He has had a life-long commitment and involvement in the
education field. He has received his Bachelor\'s Degree in Education
from Westfield State College in Massachusetts. And he started teaching
in the 8th grade in 1964 in East Hartford.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.9.0}

It was not long after that he_became an Assistant Superintendent, excuse
me, an Assistant Principal, a Principal, Assistant Superintendent of
Schools, and now currently the Superintendent of Schools of the East
Hartford Public School System.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.10.0}

In short, Jim has worked his way up and has a pragmatic, handon,
understanding. The Town of East Hartford, which also happens to be my
hometown, the schools that he administers comprise of nine elementary
schools, one middle school, and one high school, one alternative high
school, and one Special Education Transitional Program with
approximately 7,000 students, and an annual budget of approximately \$57
million.

[]{#content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.11.0}

He also, at the high school, is unique in Connecticut of having over 57
different ethnic groups that matriculate at East Hartford High School.
He is on the Oversight and Comprehensive Professional Development Plan
for the East Hartford Board of Education,

Given the topic of today\'s hearing, I believe that he will provide a
unique perspective. And I thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for the
opportunity to introduce a dear friend and an esteemed colleague, Dr.
Jim Fallon.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.2.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Mr. Larson. And we certainly do welcome
Mr. Fallon as one of the people testifying. [I
]{style="font-style:italic;"}would now like to recognize, let us see,
Ms. Rivers, I know, was here. And Ms. Woolsey, from California, for any
comments.

Ms. WOOLSEY. I will yield to Mr. Udall.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.4.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. You yield to Mr. Udall. I will be happy. Mr. Udall,
do you have any opening comments?

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.5.0}

Mr. UDALL. I have no opening comments. I am eager to hear the witnesses
that have joined us today.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Madam Chair.\
Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you for yielding to him too.\

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.7.0}

[Ms. ]{style="font-style:italic;"}WOOLSEY. You are welcome. There is
nothing more frustrating than being here before somebody else and then
getting preempted. I know. Listen, thank you very much, the Chairs and
the Ranking Members, for this panel we are going to hear this afternoon.
I am one of the few members in the House of Representatives on both the
Science Committee and the Education Committee.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.8.0}

And it is crucial, I know that, from both Committees that we prepare our
young people for the 21st Century, and that we include technology in all
schools for all of our students. Otherwise, they just are not going to
be ready for the workforce in the next millennium. Because of that, I
have offered an amendment that was passed by the Committee.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.9.0}

My amendment allows the National Science Foundation to review how
schools are using technology. And making sure that they use it to the
best of their abilities, and that they can share the information between
schools so that everybody is not constantly reinventing the wheel.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.10.0}

And I know that is important because we do not want to start over every
time we have a school that decides technology is important. But we all
do know that technology and education is crucial. One of the other
barriers that I am concentrating on in both Committees and here in the
House is the question of why young girls decide, by 9th grade, that they
are not interested in science, math, and technology[?
]{style="font-style:italic;"}

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.11.0}

So, I have a bill called "Go Girl" that will mentor and encourage young
girls from the 4th grade on, so that they stay with science, math, and
technology, stay interested, see the value of it, and make sure that we
have a full workforce, not just 50 percent of the brilliant people in
the country, but 100 percent having choices in the use of technology

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.12.0}

I want to hear from you. You are the experts. And I look forward to your
testimony. Thank you.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.13.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Ms. Woolsey.

Okay. We are ready to go. Dr. George Strawn, Executive Director of the
Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate at the
National Science Foundation. NSF is very involved in a number of
Educational Technology Programs.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.2.0}

We also have Mr. Alan Spoon, President of the Washington Post. Mr. Spoon
is representing the CEO Forum on Education and Technology. He will share
with us some recommendations on how we can better prepare teachers to
integrate technology in a classroom.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.3.0}

Also joined by Dr. Elizabeth Glowa. She is the Director for
Instructional Technology Support Team, the Office of Global Access
Technology at the Montgomery County, Maryland Public Schools; great,
great school system. Montgomery County is doing a wonderful job in the
area of educational technology. And she will share with us some key
ingredients for successful Technology Programs.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.4.0}

Finally, we welcome Mr. James Fallon, the Superintendent of the East
Hartford School District. Know your School District is also on the
leading edge of technology in the classroom. So, I would now ask the
panelists, since it is a policy of the Science Committee to swear in all
of those who will testify, if you will stand, raise your right hand.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.5.0}

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

The report will indicate responses in the affirmative.\

versity, both as a computer science faculty member, and as a provider of
academic information service technologies.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.1.0}

I would like to thank Mr. Larson, and the other members here today, for
their interest and support of educational information technology. Having
been involved with both education and information technology all of my
career, I strongly believe that information technology is in the early
stages of transforming how we learn, just as it is transforming other
important aspects of how we work and how we live.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.2.0}

I think Mr. Smith asks an important question when he says, is it
transforming how we think? And is it assisting us to think better? And I
think the honest answer is we do not know yet. Us true believers think
so. As with other dimensions of information technology, sometimes it
takes awhile to verify our beliefs.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.3.0}

I further believe that the U.S. citizens are well-served by such Members
of Congress as you, who clearly share a vision of the importance of
information technology. The National Science Foundation has been a major
force in the history of the Internet, as have other federal agencies.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.4.0}

From 1965 to 1985, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
Department of Defense carried out long-term research in computer
networking that resulted in the definition of and early implementations
of the Internet. From 1985 until 1995, the National Science Foundation
played a pivotal role by building the first and the second national high
performance Internet backbone networks. The first was built in 1988.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.5.0}

The second in 1991. Of course, the definition of "high performance" is
constantly changing. Today, the NSF VBNS high performance network has
links that are about 2,000 times faster than the higher performance NSF
net of 1988. A part of NSF\'s contribution to the emergence of the
Internet that has much relevance to the proposed Science and Educational
Networking Act was our socalled Connections Program.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.6.0}

From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, we have estimated that NSF
assisted as many as 2,000 institutions of higher learning to connect to
the Internet. And beginning in 1996, we have also forwarded research and
development in novel technologies that could lower the cost of
and[/]{style="font-style:italic;"}or lower other barriers to bringing
the Internet more quickly to public schools and libraries.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.7.0}

I have a page or so of material that describes our partnering with the
private sector, but given time limitations, I would ask that you refer
to my written material for that.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.8.0}

I mentioned since 1995, NSF and other federal agencies have been
participating in the Next Generation Internet Initiative, which has
accelerated advanced networking research, created high performance
networking test beds for the research community, and stimulated the
emergence of revolutionary science and engineering that require high
performance networking.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.9.0}

The agencies participating in this so-called NGI Initiative have also
been working closely with the complementary Internet-II project, which
is a collaborative venture of more than 100 research universities who
are also pursuing advances in high performance networking

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.0.0}

As our previous and continuing activities indicate, NSF has been and
continues to be a leader in educational networking. We believe that the
time is approaching when lowered cost and increased ease of use of
Internet products and services will enable high performance networking
in all public schools and libraries.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.1.0}

As you no doubt know, schools and libraries are currently being
connected to the Internet at a very rapid pace as a result of the E-Rate
Program. In the first year of the Program, 640,000 classrooms were
connected to the Internet. This year, \$2.4 billion is available to
connect an expected 528,000 more classrooms. Eighty percent of public

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.2.0}

schools and 50 percent of public libraries participate in the E-Rate
Program. Some schools and libraries have already used E-Rate support for
high speed large band-width capacity connections. Given the success of
this Program, one way that we could add value is to encourage the
identification of best educational practices, to provide educators and
policy makers with tools for using existing and evolving Internet
technologies more effectively as a part of our educational strategy. An
often overlooked consideration in this discussion relates to resources
required to train teachers and provide the technical support to
effectively use Internet technologies in schools and libraries.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.3.0}

These questions cannot be answered, given our current level of
understanding about using Internet as an educational tool. But I am, of
course, very pleased to hear about Ms. Morella\'s and others\' activity
in this area to support additional teacher training in this area.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.4.0}

The need to better understand costs, capabilities, human resource
requirements, potential educational benefits of universal high speed
Internet access to schools is clear. NSF stands ready to work with
Congressman Larson, and the committees, as well as other agencies with a
stake in educational technology to develop an effective mechanism to
inform policy makers in this rapidly evolving world of networking.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.5.0}

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on this important matter.
And I would be happy to try to answer any questions that you may have.

much relevance to the proposed Science and Educational Networking Act
was our \"Connections Program\". From the late 1980s to the late 1990s,
we have estimated that NSF assisted as many as 2000 institutions of
higher learning to connect to the Internet. And beginning in 1996, we
have also supported R[&]{style="font-style:italic;"}D in novel
technologies that could lower the cost of
and[/]{style="font-style:italic;"}or lower other barriers to bringing
the Internet to public schools and libraries.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA13.w.2.0.0}

One other important part of NSF\'s contribution to the creation of the
Internet involved the manner in which we partnered with private industry
during the 1985-1995 decade of development. Major telecommunications
providers including MCI, Sprint, and AT[&]{style="font-style:italic;"}T
were partners with NSF during this time as were major computer companies
such as IBM. Also, the first two private sector Internet Service
Providers, UUnet and PSI, were commercializations of networking
activities that had been initiated by NSF and other government agencies.
Moreover, by enabling private sector organizations to participate with
universities and colleges in the formation of regional networks, which
attached to the NSFNET backbone, very rapid transfer of technology to
the private sector was set in motion. By 1992 we were already planning
our phased withdrawal from Internet backbone network service provision,
and in 1995 we were able to \"retire\" the NSFNET and tum the entire
backbone business over to the new Internet industry.

Since 1995, NSF and other agencies have been participating in the
federal Next Generation Internet Initiative (NGI) which has accelerated
advanced networking research, created high performance networking
testbeds for the research community, and stimulated the emergence of
revolutionary science and engineering that require high performance
networking. The agencies participating in the NGI Initiative have also
been working closely with the complementary Internet2 project, which is
a collaborative venture of more than 100 research universities who are
also pursuing advances in high performance networking.

[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA13.w.4.0.0}

As our previous and continuing activities indicate, NSF has been, and
is, a leader in educational networking. We believe that the time is
approaching when lowered costs and increased ease of use of Internet
products and services will enable high performance networking in all
public schools and libraries.

As you no doubt know, schools and libraries are currently being
connected to the Internet at a very rapid pace as a result of the E-rate
program. In the first year of the program, 640,000 classrooms were
connected to the Internet. This year, \$2.25 billion is available to
connect an expected 528,000 more classrooms. 80% of public schools and
50% of public libraries participate in the E-rate program. Some schools
and libraries have already used E-rate support for high-speed large
bandwidth capacity connections.

Given the success of this program, one way that we could add value is to
encourage the identification of best educational practices to provide
educators and policy makers with tools for using existing and evolving
Internet technology more effectively as a part of
our[]{#content-0007.xml#GBS.PA14.w.1.0.0}[ An often overlooked

The need to better understand the costs, capabilities, human resource
requirements, and potential educational benefits of universal high speed
internet access to schools is clear. NSF stands ready to work with
Congressman Larson and the Committee, as well as other agencies with a
stake in educational technology, to develop an effective mechanism to
inform policy makers in the rapidly evolving world of networking.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.1.0}

We are now pleased to hear from Mr. Alan Spoon.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.2.0}

Mr. SPOON. Madam Chairman, Chairman Smith, Congressman Barcia, other
members of the Committee, it really is an honor to be here today
representing the CEO Forum on Education and Technology. The CEO Forum is
a coalition of corporate and academic leaders who formed a 4-year
partnership to assess and monitor progress toward integrating technology
in American schools.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.3.0}

Our objective is to help ensure that our Nation\'s students will achieve
higher academic standards through enriched learning, and will be
equipped with the skills they need to be contributing citizens and
productive workers in the next Century. Our first Report on Hardware and
Connectivity, issued in late 1997, found that most schools lacked the
hardware and connections needed to truly benefit the students\'
learning.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.4.0}

While a majority of schools were connected to the Internet, in many
cases, it was a single connection, to a single computer, to be shared by
scores of students. The CEO Forum also developed what is now known as
the School Technology And Readiness or STAR Chart, a self-assessment
tool that schools can use to determine their level of technology
readiness.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.5.0}

This tool has been sent to hundreds of school districts around the
Country, and received strong support from the K-12 community. The State
of North Carolina has even adopted the chart as its formal measure of
technology integration in schools Statewide.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.6.0}

Our year two report focused on the topic of professional development.
And I will have more to say about that in a moment. Our year three
report, due out in early 2000, will address the topic of digital content
and what broad-band delivery can contribute to the learning process.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.7.0}

The year four report on outcomes and assessment will look at how
technology and integration can make a measurable difference in American
education. Since the CEO Forum began its work, the number of connected
schools has jumped dramatically, from 35 percent to, I am guessing,
nearly 100 percent today.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.8.0}

The number of wired classrooms, per school, has also increased
substantially, and now stands at 43 or more percent. Encouraging as this
progress is, we found very few teachers who could integrate the new
technology into their curriculum. They are not being adequately trained
to do so, nor is the new generation of teachers.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.9.0}

One-third of our schools of education believe that they are illequipped
to teach teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom. More
than half of the Nation\'s schools consider technology training and
education for teachers optional. Twenty-five states, the number may have
changed since, but 25 states as of the time of my report, do not require
a computer education for initial licensor.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.10.0}

Only two States, at the time of my report, North Carolina and Vermont,
require teaching candidates to demonstrate that they can use technology.
We also found the current spending on professional development is
inadequate; a false precision, but we found
about[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.0.0}[ \$5.65 per student, or 5
percent of overall school technology budgets in the last school year,
compared to \$88 and change for hardware, software, and
connectivity.]{#content-0011.xml#para.20.1.0.box.110.296.1776.178.q.101

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.1.0}

We think professional development should claim approximately 30 percent
of these budgets, mirroring our own level of such investment in the
business world, and the Department of Education agrees. Given all of
this, it is not surprising that just 20 percent of teachers felt, as you
have heard in opening remarks from many of you, 20 percent of teachers
felt they were well-prepared to integrate technology into classroom
instruction.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.2.0}

This is not good enough. America\'s elementary and secondary schools are
likely to hire two million teachers over the next decade. Those teachers
simply must be able to apply the wonders of modern technology in service
of their students. In addition, the roughly three million teachers
already at work in our public schools must be trained to use technology
in the classroom as well.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.3.0}

These teachers are responsible for equipping today\'s students for
tomorrow\'s workforce. Sixty percent of the jobs available, at the
beginning of the next Century, will require technology skills currently
held by only 20 percent of the workforce. That is a wide gap. And it
cannot be bridged without adequate professional development of
America\'s current, as well as future teachers.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.4.0}

Why is all of this so important? Because the greater use of technology
in education can, not only foster productive drill and practice, but can
lead as well to higher order of thinking, more collaborative learning,
and teamwork, greater use of information resources, and ultimately the
customization of learning that will end forever the teacher\'s perineal
imperative to teach to the middle.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.5.0}

With a base level of technology and connections now embedded in American
schools, it is time to focus new attention, and energy, and resources on
ensuring that tomorrow\'s and today\'s teachers are prepared to put
technology to work in classrooms for the benefit of their students.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.6.0}

The CEO Forum on Education and Technology recommends the following:

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.7.0}

1\. Schools of education should prepare new teachers to integrate
technology effectively into the curriculum. Accreditation standards,
faculty training, licensor and certification, and funding priorities
should all be reformed with this objective in mind.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.8.0}

The CEO Forum will soon publish a Teacher Preparation STAR Chart to help
schools, colleges, and departments of education assess their_level of
technology readiness in preparing tomorrow\'s teachers. The chart should
be ready shortly after the first of the year. And it will be made
available to every school of education in America.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.9.0}

2\. Current teachers and administrators should be proficient in
integrating technology into curriculum. To accomplish this objective,
continuing education and proficiency standards should be strengthened.
Professional Development Programs should be updated. Technology access
and technology funding should be increased.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.10.0}

3\. Education policy makers and school administrators should create
systems that reward the integration of technology into the curriculum.
The means adjusting hiring standards, making
teacher[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.0.0}[ performance evaluations
contingent on successful integration, rethinking student performance
assessments to reflect the educational benefits of technology
application.]{#content-0011.xml#para.21.1.0.box.359.304.1769.182.q.101

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.1.0}

4\. And last, corporations and local businesses should work with the
education community to help ensure that today\'s students will graduate
with 21st Century workplace skills that we have all talked about
already.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.2.0}

Among other things, and there are many, this means working with colleges
of education, as we have done for years with business schools, to
devise, and encourage, and help fund an effective real world curriculum
that demonstrates the power of technology-enhanced teaching.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.3.0}

So, the bottom line is clear, to improve the way teachers teach, the way
students learn, and the way students and schools perform, we need to
improve technology, professional development throughout a teacher\'s
career. The CEO Forum is committed to this work, and we are very
grateful for this Committee\'s commitment and leadership in this field,
as demonstrated by this important hearing today. Thank you.

technology - hardware & connectivity, professional development, content,
and outcomes & assessments. These pillars are all essential to improving
student achievement through technology.

to truly impact students\' learning. While a majority of schools were

Our Year 2 report focused on the topic of professional development,
which I will explain in more detail in a moment. But we would also like
you to know that our Year 3 report, which is currently underway and
expected to be complete in early 2000, will address the topic of
\"Digital Content\" and how new forms of content and delivery impact
learning. The Year 4 report on \"Outcomes & Assessment will sum up all
of the Forum\'s work by looking at how all of these issues collectively

Year 2 Report on Professional Development By the time we began preparing
our Year 2 report on professional development, the number of connected
K-12 schools had jumped dramatically, from 35 percent to 78 percent.
Today, that figure is nearing the 100 percent mark. We also found the
number of wired classrooms per school had increased substantially, from
35 percent to 43 percent.

We were encouraged that more schools were finding their way to the
Internet. However, we found very few teachers who could integrate the
new technology into their curriculum. We looked at teacher education
institutions and found at least one third of them did not have the
facilities to

More than half of the nation\'s schools considered technology training
and education for teachers \"optional.\" A mere 20 percent of teachers
felt they were well prepared to integrate technology into classroom
instruction.

Only two states at the time of our report - North Carolina and Vermont -
required teaching candidates to have a portfolio that demonstrated a use
of technology. We also found that current spending on professional
development is inadequate. It is the CEO Forum\'s recommendation that at
least one-third of all technology spending be put toward professional
development. This is what we do in industry when we take into account
the Total Cost of Ownership of technology, and we suggest that schools
consider adopting this same practice.

It is clear from these findings that professional development requires
our attention if we are to continue the progress we\'ve made in bringing
technology to our schools. K-12 schools are likely to hire two million
new teachers over the next decade to fill vacancies left by retiring
teachers and to accommodate class-size reduction efforts and increasing
student populations.

More than ever before, employers in all industries are demanding that
their employees have basic technology skills and skills enabled by the
use of technology. K-12 schools play a fundamental role in educating our
workforce and their importance will only increase as the economy becomes
more dependent on greater skills and education.

Only now are America\'s schools of education beginning to focus on
preparing their students - our future teachers - to understand and
embrace the power of technology-based teaching. The challenge is great:
many faculty at these institutions lack the skills and experience
necessary to turn technology into an effective learning tool for
themselves and for their students. Most faculty members do not stress or
demonstrate the effective use of information technology skills in
teaching

The members of the CEO Forum believe professional development for
teachers is an ongoing, long-term, critical commitment that begins with
the decision to pursue a career in education and continues, through a
combination of formal and informal learning opportunities, for the
duration of a teaching career.
:::

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA21.w.5.0.0}

Teachers in our nation\'s K-12 schools work an average of 45 hours per
week with 33 of those spent at school. Of the remaining 12 hours,
teachers spend slightly more than three hours on activities involving
students and almost nine on other teaching-related activities.
Consequently, many dedicated teachers sacrifice their personal time to
learn about technology. These teachers are to be commended, but
self-directed training should supplement - not substitute for
appropriate and ongoing professional development.

Therefore, with a base level of technology and connections now embedded
in American schools, it is time to focus new attention, energy, and
resources on ensuring that teachers are prepared to put technology to
work in their classrooms for the benefit of their students.

1\) Schools of education should prepare new teachers to integrate
technology effectively into

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA22.w.2.1.0}

the curriculum. National accreditation standards for schools of
education should be changed by the year 2000 to require those schools to
prepare new teachers and administrators to integrate technology into the
classroom. Schools of education should be encouraged to provide faculty
with the tools, incentives, and ongoing professional development they
need to integrate technology into the teacher-training curriculum by
2001. New teacher and administrator licensure and certification programs
should be implemented which require proficiency in integrating
technology into the curriculum by 2003. And technology funding should be
increased for schools of education.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA22.w.3.0.0}

I should mention here that the CEO Forum will soon publish a \"Teacher
Preparation STaR Chart to help schools, colleges and departments of
education assess their level of technology readiness in preparing
tomorrow\'s teachers. This self-assessment tool should be by complete by
December of this year.

The CEO Forum also commends the U.S. Department of Education\'s recent
award of \$135 million in grants to train 400,000 new teachers in the
use of technology in education. The development of programs like the
Department\'s Preparing Tomorrow\'s Teachers to Use Technology (PTTT)
initiative is a clear indication that Congress is serious about
addressing this need.

2\) Current teachers and administrators should be proficient in
integrating technology into the

curriculum. The CEO Forum recommends that every state develop standards
for effective continuing education on integrating technology into the
curriculum by 2000. Schools and districts should establish long-term
technology-related professional development plans and proficiency
standards for all teachers and administrators by 2000. Every teacher and
administrator should have ready access to appropriate communications and
information technology. Resources for technology-related professional
development should be increased. And every professional development
program should integrate technology as a part of all training
components.

the integration of technology into the curriculum. Hiring standards for
teachers and administrators should be adjusted to include technology
integration proficiency by fall 2000, and this proficiency should be
mandatory by 2002. Policy-makers and education administrators should
make a commitment by 2000 to prepare for technology-inclusive
professional development as a means of ensuring teacher and student
success in the classroom. Performance evaluations for in-service
teachers and school administrators should encourage and reward
technology integration and innovation by 2000. Subjectbased curriculum
standards and measurements should include appropriate technology
integration components by 2002. And student performance assessments
should capture the educational benefits enabled by technology by 2002.

help ensure that today\'s students will graduate with 21st century
workplace skills. Corporations and local businesses should collaborate
with schools of education and K-12 schools to provide support and share
relevant best practices for integrating technology. The business
community should organize and sponsor technology leadership seminars for
principals and school administrators. We should provide leadership and
guidance on skills requirements that exist in the workplace. And we
should work with colleges of education, as we have done for years with
business schools, to devise, encourage and help fund an effective,
real-world curriculum that demonstrates the power of technologyenhanced
teaching.

We believe the bottom line is clear: to improve the way teachers teach,
the way students learn, and the way students and schools perform, we
need to improve technology-related professional development throughout a
teacher\'s career. The CEO Forum is committed to this work, and we are
very grateful for this Committee\'s commitment and leadership in this
field, as demonstrated by this important hearing today.

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you very much, Dr. Spoon.

I would now like to recognize Dr. Glowa, but I wanted to also
acknowledge the fact that Mr. Smith from Texas is here with us. Mr.
Capuano from Massachusetts has also joined us.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.2.0}

Dr. Glowa, from my Congressional District.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.3.0}

Dr. GLOWA. Thank you for this opportunity to address the Committee. I am
the Director of Instructional Technology for Montgomery County Public
Schools. Montgomery County has 189 schools with over 133,000 students.
We are currently the 11th fastest growing school district in the Nation.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.4.0}

Five years ago, we began the Global Access Project, an initiative to
bring technology and on-line resources into every classroom and office.
Currently, 100 percent of our schools are networked to the Internet, and
about 80 percent of our classrooms. We are continuing this initiative.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.5.0}

The initiative was built on a tripod consisting of training and support,
hardware and software, and connectivity. As we have implemented the
project, we have been collecting data on the effectiveness of its
implementation. This data has provided us with feedback on what has
worked, what we need to modify, and the impact of technology on teaching
and learning.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.6.0}

Today, I am going to discuss the importance of staff development, in
supporting the successful integration of technology in schools. If
technology is to realize its powerful potential for improving education,
it must be used for more than just automating the traditional methods
and practices of teaching. That is the philosophy that we have adopted
as we have been integrating technology into the school system.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.7.0}

For staff development to be effective, it must be ongoing, integrated
with the school district, and individual school strategic plans, and
instructional priorities, and offered collaboratively within a
curricular context. In addition, instructional staff, which includes
teachers, aids, librarians, and administrators, approach learning to use
technology with different skill and comfort levels.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.8.0}

Taking these factors into account and designing staff development
programs is essential. In an effective staff development program a
variety of approaches are used. In Montgomery County, we use at least 17
different approaches in our Staff Development Programs.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.9.0}

They include coaching, modeling in the classroom, mentoring, student
experts, large and small workshops, sharing and collaboration, on-line
mentoring and collaboration, trainers of trainers, individualized
support, demonstration classrooms, multi-media interactive training,
on-line tutorials and courses, cable casting programs over our cable
stations, training in the field, sending people to attend conferences
and present at conferences, action research, teleconferencing, and
just-in-time support. Unless there is a comprehensive Staff Development
Program being able to change the teaching practices of teaching, of
teachers, becomes a monumental task.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.10.0}

The knowledge and skills that instructional staff need to master extend
far beyond learning how to use software programs. Staff must learn to
use technology in an instructional context to support teaching and
learning. Not only do teachers need to learn to
use[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.0.0}[ the equipment and software
programs within the contents of the instructional program, they also
need to learn how to incorporate a variety of teaching strategies,
materials, and resources into their
program.]{#content-0011.xml#para.31.1.0.box.263.320.1769.246.q.101

They need to select appropriate teaching strategies and technologies
based upon student outcomes. They need to change the way they assess
student learning to include a wider range of assessment techniques,
including ways to evaluate the use of technology itself. Managing, and
scheduling, and instructional use of technology is also a new skill for
many teachers.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.2.0}

Administrators not only need to learn to use equipment and the software
relevant to their roles, but they also have to learn how to develop and
communicate a vision of how technology can support student achievement
and staff functioning.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.3.0}

They need to incorporate technology into their local School Improvement
Plans. Unless technology is an integral part of a School Improvement
Plan, it is considered an add-on, and therefore is not given the
attention that it needs. Administrators need to model the use of
technology and the role of an active learner.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.4.0}

They need to support staff in learning and using technology as a tool
for instruction, as well as for productivity. It is difficult for
individual schools to handle all of the aspects of staff development
needed to integrate technology into instructional practices.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.5.0}

In the written testimony, I talked about some of the costs and
difficulties associated with the integration of technology in
classrooms. Primary to overcoming the barriers for schools, are issues
related to planning and implementation of staff development.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.6.0}

Schools can provide the instructional context, the just-in-time support,
the coaching, and the mentoring that are so essential. Schools are also
ideally situated for developing communities of learners. However, based
upon research studies and 5 years of experience with supporting the
implementation of a County-wide Global Access Initiative, many, if not
most, schools have significant problems in the following eight areas:

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.7.0}

1\. Examining their school achievement data, and developing a School
Improvement Plan that incorporates the use of technology as an
instructional tool to support student achievement.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.8.0}

2\. Defining the skills that students need in developing a sequence of
activities to build these skills using technology as a tool, always
emphasizing that technology is the tool. It is not the means, it is not
the end, but a means to an end.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.9.0}

3\. Defining skills that teachers need to successfully integrate
technology into their instructional program based upon the School
Improvement Plan.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.10.0}

4\. Developing and implementing an appropriate long-range staff
development plan based on a staff needs assessment.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.11.0}

5\. Meeting the needs of adult learners who are scattered along a
continuum of novice to expert in their knowledge of different software
programs and their instructional applications.

[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.12.0}

Another area is having adequate lab facilities and staff who are experts
in technology, instructional strategies, curriculum, and staff
development. Having knowledge of and access to human, appropriate human
material, and network resources, and having
suf[]{#content-0011.xml#GBS.PA29.w.1.0.0}[ficient funds and time to

Five years ago we began the Global Access Project, an initiative to
bring technology and on-line resources into every classroom and office.
This initiative was built on a tripod consisting of training and
support, hardware and software, and connectivity. As we have implemented
this project, we have been collecting data on the effectiveness of its
implementation and the impact of technology on teaching and learning.
Today I will discuss the importance of staff development in supporting
the successful integration of technology in schools.

For staff development to be effective, it must be continuous, integrated
with the school district and individual school strategic plans and
instructional priorities, and offered collaboratively within a
curricular context. In addition, instructional staff, teachers, aides,
librarians, and administrators, approach learning to use technology with
different skill and comfort levels. Taking these factors into account in
designing staff development programs is essential.

1\. What are the costs and difficulties associated with a successful
integration of technology in the classroom? Costs:

[]{#content-0021.xml#GBS.PA37.w.3.1.0}

There are obvious and less obvious costs associated with the successful
integration of technology in the classroom. Although the obvious costs
are generally included in the funding of a school system\'s
implementation plan for instructional technology, the less obvious costs
sometimes are not included in the initial planning. School systems
struggle with funding these costs. Many times the obvious costs can be
funded with capital budget initiatives when the school system initially
builds the infrastructure, equips the schools, and provides baseline
staff training. The less obvious costs are ongoing costs and generally
must be funded from the school system\'s operating budget. Support from
grants and contributions from the private sector can also help defray
the costs.

One major non-budget cost also should be considered. Whenever a teacher
learns something new, it takes time to internalize what is learned and
to apply this learning effectively and seamlessly to the instructional
program. Teachers who are learning new technologies and their
application in the instructional program spend considerably more time
planning lessons than previously. Once the teachers have mastered the
new skills and knowledge to the point that they are a seamless part of
their thinking, the amount of time that must be devoted to planning
returns to a more normal level. This extra time that teachers spend
often goes unrecognized.

the number one barrier to using technology.\
School practices regarding the scheduling of labs and the media center

influence\
teacher and student access.\
Schools need sufficient equipment to place computers in the labs,

Collaboration of the private sector, higher education institutions,
government agencies, and a public school system has been successfully
modeled in Montgomery County, Maryland. This partnership has been based
upon mutual recognition that each member brings something useful to the
partnership, and that the partnership builds upon and extends the
expertise of each institution. The Geographic Information System (GIS)
and Smithsonian National Air and Space Partnerships are examples of
this. The GIS involves Towson University, Montgomery County Park and
Planning Commission, and Montgomery County Public Schools in a
collaborative effort to facilitate the student use of GIS files to
analyze authentic data. The Smithsonian National Air and Space
Partnership involves the Smithsonian, NASA, and MCPS in developing
lesson plans using resources from NASA and staff training provided by
the Smithsonian.

One key consideration by any organization partnering with a pre-K-12
institution is that schools and teachers are under intense pressure to
improve student performance. Anything that impacts the classroom and
instruction that is not based on improving student performance within
the curricular context is viewed as an add-on and is not likely to be
adopted or, if adopted, is not likely to be sustained.

for and publication of research has been helpful. Increased
communication about these efforts and supports would assist schools.
Grants designed to diminish the challenge of afterschool access issues
for staff and students, particularly in high poverty areas, and grants
to support the staff development needs of schools continue to be a
priority need.

It is difficult for individual schools to handle all of the aspects of
staff training needed to integrate technology into instructional
practices. In responding to the first question about the costs and
difficulties associated with successful integration of technology in
classrooms, a number of practices essential to overcoming barriers to
effective staff development were described. Primary to overcoming
barriers are those issues relating to support for planning and
implementation of staff development activities. Schools can provide the
instructional context, the just-in-time support, the coaching, and the
mentoring that are so essential to successful staff development
programs. Schools are ideally situated for developing community of
learners.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA42.w.3.0.0}

The existence of a dedicated instructional technology support unit would
greatly assist schools in planning and implementing staff development
activities. This unit would need to be composed of staff members who are
experts in schoolbased technology hardware tools and software,
instructional strategies, curriculum, and staff development. Since
curriculum and instructional strategies vary greatly along the pre-K-12
continuum and are dependent upon the developmental stages of the
learners as well as the content demands, there need to be instructional
specialists who are experts in not only these developmental stages, but
also the content areas.

Chairwoman MORELLA. Very extensive and well-organized. Delighted you are
here, Dr. Glowa[. ]{style="font-style:italic;"}We are now very pleased
to hear from Dr. Fallon.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.1.0}

Dr. FALLON. Thank you, Madam Chair. Members of the Committee, the East
Hartford School District is an urban, suburban district with a variety
of educational settings; nine elementary schools, one middle school, one
high school, two magnet schools, one alternative high school, one
transitional school, grades k-12, for high risk special education
students, and an early childhood head start school.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.2.0}

The student population is 7,958 students. Our
minority[/]{style="font-style:italic;"}majority enrollment is 59.3
percent, and 31.3 percent of all students receive free and reduced
priced meals. Students with a non-English home language comprise 15.7
percent of our student body. Four hundred twenty computers are located
in classroom settings in the elementary schools.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.3.0}

Seventy computers in laboratory settings at the middle school, and 175
computers in laboratory settings in the high school and alternative
school, with some exceptions. Fifty PCs donated by local corporations,
computers are purchased or leased new. Staff development for technology
has emphasized the infusion of technology into the curriculum.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.4.0}

Basic application training, Microsoft Office, aims at giving teachers
the ability to use technology in their daily instruction, and to enable
students to use technology as a learning tool. All our schools have
access to the Internet. Four work stations in every elementary
classroom, grades 3 to 6, and multi-lab access in the middle and high
schools. This level of Internet connection has been possible only
through a State of Connecticut Infrastructure Grant, not obtained by
many school districts, and a special State of Connecticut Economic
Development Grant.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.5.0}

Students use the technology for basic research, both CD-ROM and the
Internet, for writing exercises, for the creation of presentations, and
we are beginning to look at the development of higher level thinking
skills. Our district-wide strategic plan contains strategies for the
further implementation of information technology into the curriculum.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.6.0}

We have six strategies within our Strategic Plan. Two of those
strategies deal with technology. Five years ago, we did not have one
strategy that dealt with technology. Funding remains a crucial problem,
both for support staff and for technology purchase.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.7.0}

Our approach, up to this point, has been to install the most robust
infrastructure we can afford, with the idea of it being able to handle
future technology developments. Numerous workshops, funded through our
own professional development monies and through outside professional
development grants, have continued to be designed to help teachers
integrate their teaching with the available technology.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.8.0}

We have limited training in system maintenance to six individuals. As
wide area networks and their operating systems have become more complex,
we cannot rely upon classroom teachers to keep the hardware optional or
operational. Major wiring and network configuration is contracted
through outside services. The
only[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.0.0}[ federal support we presently

Our purchasing investment decisions are shaped by such factors as ease
of use, the kind of system support provided, and the type of grants
available. Funding serves as a keystone to all decisions. Two computer
laboratories we are presently bringing on-line in the middle and the
high school are being setup by commercial vendors that place advertising
on their browsers and collect student data.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.2.0}

We have been forced to work with this type of vendor because of our
concern for providing our student population with equal access to
information technology. Another key component of this decision is the
provisions these firms provide for maintenance and repair.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.3.0}

Overhead costs are the bottom 23 of the iceberg in implementing computer
technology in the schools. The Internet access we provide our students
is crucial to their remaining competitive, both in the marketplace and
in furthering their education. Most of our families do not have Internet
access in their homes. Even telephone service can be very sporadic.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.4.0}

Not to provide these students with training in the use of information
technology will lead to a further widening of the racial, social, and
economic divide that threatens the very essence or existence of our
democracy. By earmarking federal monies to focus specifically on the
provision of information tech in all schools, Congress is addressing a
major fault line in American society.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.5.0}

New technologies that facilitate the sharing of teaching units, and
expertise among teachers in school districts over the worldwide Web,
promise a much more effective use of resources, than has been possible
by isolated individual teachers acting alone. These new teaching tools
are expensive, though more cost effective than present distant learning
technologies.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.6.0}

The development of a critical mass of teaching expertise and experience
in the use of information technology in the classroom will provide a
reliable continuing source of funding and other kinds of federal
support. Laws requiring a greater classroom presence of public
utilities, such as cable companies, for example, could further leverage
whatever monies the Federal Government cannot furnish. Progress of this
nature will not be possible without effective federal legislation. Thank
you.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.0.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Dr. Fallon.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.1.0}

You have all been terrific in your presentations. I am now going to
recognize for the first round of questioning Chairman Smith.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.2.0}

Mr. SMITH. Well, let me start out with maybe what I consider tough
questions. When should a school upgrade its computers? Do not give me if
you are going to use the word "obsolete" or something, define it.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.3.0}

Dr. FALLON. Our plan is that we now have pretty much somewhat in place
what we wish to have, at least for the present. In terms of updating,
there is no way that we can do it on a yearly basis, in terms of taking
care of the changes that we have that are occurring. So, our plan very
simply is this.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.4.0}

Every year, we allot 20 percent of the budget that goes toward
technology, so we are looking at over 5 years changing our entire system
and updating. And that is our plan. So, for example, we have figured
roughly

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.5.0}

Mr. SMITH. That is sort of the answer I wanted.\
Dr. FALLON. Okay.\

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.6.0}

Mr. SMITH. You are saying roughly every 5 years. Some businesses and
companies suggest that when they can improve their efficiency 25
percent, then they upgrade. Some companies decide when they can improve
their efficiency 40 percent to try to keep down their cost. And so, I am
just wondering in terms of the utilization within schools. Anybody else
have any reaction to that?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.7.0}

Mr. STRAWN. Mr. Smith, I would just mention that having just sent a son
off to college, who is badgering me for a very expensive computer, he
makes the argument that if I can buy him the top of the line now, he
thinks it will last him for 4 years. And my addition to

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.8.0}

Mr. SMITH. It will not.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.9.0}

Mr. STRAWN. Well, probably not. He will change his mind 2 years from
now. But one rule of thumb is try to use a computer at least until the
software you want to use will not run on it anymore. Advances in
software often dictate when you cannot use an old piece of hardware.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.10.0}

Mr. SMITH. Well, I mean, that is certainly true. So, you use your old
hardware. I mean, it is easy to, if you are going to make your decisions
based simply on the new more efficient software, then my guess is you
are going to be changing every 2 years or every 2.5 years.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.11.0}

A question that is sort of maybe on the periphery of the discussion of
technology education, Mr. Spoon, do you think there is merit in students
learning how to read technical journals? I will not even talk about
writing technical journals, but reading a technical journal. Would you
consider this part of technology skills?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.12.0}

Mr. SPOON. No.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.13.0}

Mr. SMITH. And so, is there a broader question. Is it, would you think
it is an appropriate part of our K-12 education to move in the direction
of helping students be able to read and write technical journals?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.14.0}

Mr. SPOON. No. I---you have heard a phrase used in Dr. Glowa\'s remarks,
"tools." This is what the computers and the network

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.15.0}

can be. They can be seamless invisible tools for a higher purpose. That
does not suggest that some people will have a great appetite for
an[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.0.0}[ interest in delving deeply
into the possibilities and the capabilities
technologically.]{#content-0030.xml#para.56.1.0.box.130.308.1764.126.q.101

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.1.0}

There is precious little time in the course of a K-12 education to be
turning to trade school kinds of applications in skill development when
these tools are available for learning reading, writing, mathematics,
history, critical thinking.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.2.0}

Mr. SMITH. Yes. I am just a little nervous about if you go to your local
auto mechanic and look at the journal that they are reading, and that
they are trying to consume and evaluate, many of them right out of high
school, then it seems to me that we have got to be very careful in the
goals that we are trying to achieve as we develop theseas we utilize the
additional technical tools that are available to us.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.3.0}

And how much traditionally, it seems to me, there has been a great push
on the part of parents to say, do what you need to do so my kid can go
to the next level up and graduate from a university. And I am just not
sure. Mr. Fallon, what is you reaction?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.4.0}

Dr. FALLON. My reaction is the same in terms of technical journals. That
is something that we specialize in probably in the junior year of high
school, with a certain small segment of the population that is
interested in pursuing something like that. But that really is not our
goal.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.5.0}

Mr. SMITH. Yes. I am going to query that later in terms of just the need
for more of our students, even in the university level, to be able to
understand some of these technical manuals. It seems reasonable. Yes,
Ms. Glowa.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.6.0}

Dr. GLOWA. One of the things that we are really emphasizing with
students is reading for information and being able to read in a variety
of contexts. And being able to read whether you call them technical
manuals, or being able to read scientific reports is a skill that is
stressed across many content areas. There are also computer sciences
classes that are very specifically designed for students who want to
pursue the computer science area.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.7.0}

They are some of our most popular high school elective classes, and in
fact are coming down into the middle school area, by popular demand. So,
teaching it as an isolated skill, in terms of reading technical manuals,
I am not

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.8.0}

Mr. SMITH. Yes. It is not an isolated skill.\
Dr. GLOWA. Right.\
Dr. SMITH. It takes a great deal of broad education.\

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.9.0}

Ms. GLOWA. But teaching it as one of the areas where what we are trying
to do is teach students how to read a variety of information and be able
to understand it and analyze it is essential.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.10.0}

Mr. SMITH. Let me finish up, Madam Chairman, if I might. Would the
millions of dollars government spends in this area, have any studies
been published in terms of the educational effectiveness of technology
in the classroom? Either now or later, if you could furnish this.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.11.0}

Dr. GLOWA. The U.S. Department of Education had a conference this July
that was taking a look at the research that has been published recently
on the effectiveness of technology. One of the major studies that just
came out, and you may know the authors. I have it memorized as one that
was done in West Virginia, where West Virginia did a Statewide
initiative and showed concrete results,
in[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.0.0}[ terms of basic skill students,

Another one was another Statewide initiative. And I believe it was
Idaho. And they have some very concrete information on that. [We

have local school system data. That at this point, the U.S. State
Department of Education is interested in obtaining.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.2.0}

Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Madam Chairman.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.3.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Did you want to add to that, briefly, Mr. Spoon[?
]{style="font-style:italic;"}Mr. SPOON. I wanted to add to that.
Chairwoman MORELLA. I think he wanted to add.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.4.0}

Mr. SPOON. Only briefly because it comes from experience outside the
classroom. It comes from experience outside the classroom. Please
understand that my life experience, other than being an expert parent,
perhaps in trying to help my child\'s education, really is in the
business sphere. So, we have to be careful about attributing expertise
that our Forum has in the report to my personal experience in teaching.
I have not taught in classrooms.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.5.0}

Anyway, we have an education business at the Washington Business at the
Washington Post Company called Kaplan Education Centers. And we teach
thousands of students every year, over 100,000 students, both in the
college, graduate school, and the K8 level. And we use extensively
technology support customization software, networks.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.6.0}

It is clear to us and it is clear to our clientele that it is highly
efficient and highly leveraged learning for their purposes, be it
advanced chemistry for medical school entry, or preparing for the SAT,
or the law boards, or understanding what is required to be competent in
the third grade, 6 month of reading. So, my personal experience in the
business sphere is one that supports the notion that leveraged learning
from computers is well-established.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.7.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you.\
I want to recognize now Congresswoman Johnson.\
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.\

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.8.0}

I am sitting here thinking that for my State of Texas, we have many
jobs, and do not have the people with the proper background and
education to fill them. And could very well lose some of those jobs
because of it. My concern is not so much whether the students will
learn, if they have access to the technology.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.9.0}

My concern is whether or not there should be some new standards set for,
in higher education curricula to assist teachers and integrating
technology into all of the courses. We find not only very large shortage
of teachers, but also a large number of teachers that do not have these
skills. And I do not even know where we go to begin to fill this gap.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.10.0}

Could you comment on that?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.11.0}

Mr. STRAWN. Ms. Johnson, a recent publication of the National Research
Council, I think, may help us pursue this important matter. It is called
Fluency in Information Technology or "fitness" to use their terminology.
It proposes---it is a current look at what appears to be the most
important things to learn at the undergraduate level in information
technology to assist young students obtain the right skills.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.0.0}

We hope to work with them and see if we can pursue these matters in the
coming time to help spread the word on just how we enlighten our
curriculums at the undergraduate level.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.1.0}

Mr. SPOON. I have seen it in schools anecdotally, and more
systematically in business. That the power of identifying early
champions and creating clearinghouses for best practices through kind of
an intense inspirational circle where people understand the benefit of
what somebody else has discovered, and follow it, and improve on it.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.2.0}

And efforts to create clearing houses, inspired clearinghouses, and the
sharing of best practices are consistent with comments you have heard
here would be a way to go. But one of the things our report cited was
the lack of time that teachers have. It is a very full-time job, in
excess of 40 hours. Much of it, not most of it, but a large part of it
spent at home dealing with classroom matters.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.3.0}

And then on top of that, we are expecting teachers to go out on their
own initiative, and time, and perhaps expense to complete that cycle.
There are funding issues. And there are resource allocation issues, in
so far as teacher time that have to be faced. Otherwise, you know, it is
just added to the stack of high priorities.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.4.0}

Dr. GLOWA. In terms of whether or not higher educational institutions
should have technology as a core component to Teacher Preparation
Programs, we are working in a collaborative partnership with the
University of Maryland, Hopkins, Towson, and also Montgomery County
Community College.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.5.0}

Each one of those universities is looking at their current Teacher
Preparation Programs and how they are integrating technology into that.
Many of them have classes similar to the classes I took when I was
taking my teacher preparation stuff where you go and learn how to use
the computer, or learn how to use an application.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.6.0}

What they are moving towards is, as you are actually teaching the
science content classes and the math content classes, integrating the
technology in those classes as they are being taught so that people
learn how to use the technology within the content area. That will have
the most impact on teachers knowing how to use technology to teach.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.7.0}

Dr. FALLON. The same situation is now occurring at the University of
Connecticut. That just started 2 years ago, in terms of their teacher
preparation courses are concerned. That they now are mandating that
certain technology courses are a part of the curriculum. So, as these
students come out into the workforce, they are somewhat computer
literate.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.8.0}

That is somewhat unusual, I might add, in terms of Connecticut. The
other universities in Connecticut do not have that component, which is
quite interesting. The other thing that has just occurred in
Connecticut, as of July 1, every 5 years we undergo renewal of our
certification.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.9.0}

And we have to complete a total of 18 Continuing Education Units per
year or a total of 90 over 5 years. If you do not complete those, then
certainly you will not be renewed for certification. The State of
Connecticut has just mandated that 15 hours for all teachers required,
in terms of technology courses that have to be taken. That is for our
teaching staff that presently exist.

Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.2.0}

Actually, piggy-backing on the questions that have been asked, we all
know that technology alone is not going to improve the performance in
schools. That the key really are the teachers. And the CEO Forum on
Education and Technology has made a number of recommendations in this
area.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.3.0}

One calls for changing national accreditation standards for schools of
education, to require that those schools prepare new teachers and
administrators to integrate technology in the classroom. The CEO Forum
also recommends implementing new Teacher and Administrator Licensor and
Certificate Programs to require proficiency in integrating technology in
the curriculum. I wonder, Mr. Spoon, what kind of reaction have you been
receiving from administrators and teachers to those recommendations? Are
they supportive[? ]{style="font-style:italic;"}

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.4.0}

Mr. SPOON. They have been very supportive. It has been encouraging. I
think there is, as well, a swell of self-assessed pressure to move up to
the front of the class, as far as joining the leaders in matching that
standard. But up against that is the absence of resources. And the lack
of a systematic kind of accountability. It is easy to talk about effort,
but it is more difficult to talk about achievement.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.5.0}

You know, setting feasible goals and being measured thereby. Things have
moved positively over the past several years. I recall when my
daughter\'s school was looking for an education technologist, how few
schools of education actually had programs where qualified candidates
could be found. That is growing.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.6.0}

But if I recall the data correctly within our report, roughly 13 of
teachers of teaching, graduates of teaching colleges, are coming out of
institutions that, you know, having yet signed onto national voluntary
accreditation standards for adequacy and competency in technology
training. It is disturbing.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.7.0}

That number might be 25 percent now, but that is hundreds of thousands
of teachers over time. I, last week, overhear a conversation between a
parent and a very able young woman who is in college choosing majors.
And she had elected to go on to designate teaching.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.8.0}

The conversation turned, I was not a part of it, to are you going to
take any courses in computer technology and skills? And she said, no. I
am choosing teaching because I do not have to take those kinds of
courses.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.9.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. Yes. That is the kind of attitude that can occur. I
mean, English majors think they do not need to use the Internet. Yet, I
have seen some of the best teaching of poetry done with technology in
the classrooms. Of course, I grew up and I pose this would happen with
many of your teachers that you currently have, not so much the new ones
when "log-on" meant throwing a log on the fire. And a "curser\" did not
use the right language.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.10.0}

And it was only 8 years ago when that there were like 50 sites on the
Internet. Now, there are like 100,000 per day, people who,

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.1.0}

I did not know whether the rest of you wanted to comment on that at all.
Yes, Dr. Fallon.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.2.0}

Dr. FALLON. This year in East Hartford, and I am quite sure you have
already done this, but in East Hartford by November 1st, every certified
staff member must register on their computer, or on the computers that
we have, data in terms of their background. And in addition to that,
take an assessment in terms of technology.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.3.0}

And what we will be doing, and this, now, the reason we are able to do
this is because we have the help of United Technologies Corporation. And
they have assisted us, East Hartford. That is why we are where we are
today. And so what is going to be happening is that we then will
categorize every certified staff member in terms of technology

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.4.0}

There will be three levels. After that, we then, with the cooperation of
United Technologies, have setup a number of courses that our staff will
take. So, based on your level, basic meaning you just started off, there
will be certain courses that you will take. And we can monitor
everything. That also will be a part of the CEU package that I alluded
to before.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.5.0}

So, within 3 to 4 years, we are going to have an entire staff that will
be, I think, at least right in the middle in terms of technology. The
other thing that I say to our staff is there is no choice anymore. There
is no choice. I mean, it is here. It is something that we deal with on a
daily basis. And it is our responsibility to take these courses and to
be computer literate. And that is the direction that we are going.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.6.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. You are pretty unique. Is Connecticut pretty unique
in the Country for doing that?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.7.0}

Dr. FALLON. With all due respect, and I hope not too many people back
home are watching this, no. No, Connecticut is not, and that is a major
concern in terms of the government, in terms of Connecticut, et cetera.
Ironically, we are not one of the leaders in terms of technology. But
there are initiatives being established.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.8.0}

And certainly Congressman Larson has been involved historically in
Connecticut to begin moving in that particular direction. But
ironically, we are not one of the leaders in terms of technology.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.9.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. You mentioned United Technologies. Dr. Glowa, you
know, we have the 1-270 corridor. I also know that, I see from the
papers you have submitted that you have received some grants, the school
system has, to do some collaborative work with some of the business
community. And I know looking at the CEO members, you have got a lot of
heavy hitters on that list too.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.10.0}

And I know that the National Science Foundation would be aware of this
too. Are you working, are you getting cooperation from these
corporations on the 1-270 corridor? Do we need to do something more with
getting them involved? How is it working out?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.11.0}

Dr. GLOWA. There are advantages and disadvantages to being a. very large
school district. One of the disadvantages is working with some of the
industries because the fear of showing favoritism toward certain
schools. So, we do not get as much of their support

know, work something out like that. Do you want to comment on that, Mr.
Spoon about, I am sure the CEO Forum has looked into what more can be
done for partnerships?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.2.0}

Mr. SPOON. With all of the resources our membership in similarly
situated companies have, that by itself does not cover the extent of the
problem. It does not fully address the digital divide issues. We all, I
believe, are trying to put our hearts in the right place, and the
significant portions of our community budgets in the right place. It
does not reach the full extent of it. So, yes, we have another division
of our Company that is a cable company.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.3.0}

Every school we go by, we drop a cable line in there, not just for
video, but it will be for high speed Internet. And the cable industry is
working on that, as our other conduits. I am sure the phone companies
have similar offerings to make. The issue though is not hardware and
connectivity in our view alone.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.4.0}

The metaphor that I used in talking about this report about 6 months ago
was, increasingly we have put the food stuffs, and the condiments, and
the pots and pans on the shelves, in the refrigerator, and in the
kitchen. Now, it is time to teach ourselves how to become cooks of
savory meals.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.5.0}

The ingredients are being assembled. And it comes back to the teachers,
their competence, their adoption, their enthusiasm, and their
excitement. And as I develop the case for our systematic overarching
kind of role where, again, I defer to you clearly on what the federal
role can be.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.6.0}

Facilitating, stimulating, extensive awareness of where the cutting edge
is, creating in a positive way professional peer pressure so that the
school system in some other corner of Connecticut looks longingly at
what Mr. Fallon is doing and saying, what about us? And the parents in
that school district are aware of where the State ranks in a technology
readiness self-assessment like the STAR chart represented, you know.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.7.0}

The data behind that represents 80,000 schools filling out
questionnaires and updating the data base. That data is nullable and
schools are categorizable. And, yes[, ]{style="font-style:italic;"}we
all have concerns about issuing lists and being rank ordered. But when
it comes to our kids, let nothing stand in the way[.
]{style="font-style:italic;"}

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.8.0}

Urging awareness of standing of teachers in their preparation, what
percent of our in-service faculty has been through professional
development in connection with technology integration in the last 3
years[? ]{style="font-style:italic;"}I will ask that question at the
next school board meeting, you know[. ]{style="font-style:italic;"}

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.9.0}

It would be interesting to know if that became a standardized kind of
reporting fact, how school districts stood. And, you know, one could ask
what fraction of teachers coming in for licensor in the 25 states that
do not require computer education have determined that, you know, x or y
percent of those matriculating, not matriculating, but those enrolling
teachers have those skills, or should it just be a requirement? So,
there is a horty-tory role for you to play here, in addition to a
funding role.

Chairwoman MORELLA. Actually, we are moving in that direction. And I
think with our reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary School
Act, this is good opportunity we have to do some of those things. My
time has elapsed for the first round. I did not know Mr. Strawn, I did
not mean to eliminate, leave you out if you okay, well, we will get to
you the next time.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.1.0}

And now I am pleased to recognize Mr. Larson.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.2.0}

Mr. LARSON. Thank you again, Madam Chairwoman. I thank the panelists for
their very informative remarks. Let me first, by way of comment, my wife
is always quick to remind me that with respect to legislation and with
respect to technology, no piece of legislation or technology ever tucks
a child in at night, or reads to them, or gives them the kind of
nurturing. That there is just simply no substitute for a caring adult.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.3.0}

Let me also add, by way of comment, especially in lieu of the
legislation that has been submitted by both, Ms. Morella, Ms. Stabenow,
and myself, along the lines of teacher training. That I concur
wholeheartedly with Mr. Spoon about the importance of teaching

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.4.0}

Again, referring back to that Department of Commerce report and hearing
that was held. There is a need for 350,000 people currently to be
employed in the high technology system. I believe it is the business
community that ultimately is going to drive this issue.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.5.0}

And in as much as there is going to be a need for some 2 million more
teachers over the next 10 years, the component parts that [Ms.
]{style="font-style:italic;"}Morella and others have discussed with
respect to our university systems turning out competent, qualified
teachers is extraordinarily important. The efforts that the East
Hartford School System, in conjunction with United Technologies,
demonstrate what partnership, how partnerships can work when the private
sector works hand-in-glove, so to speak, with the academic sector in
helping to assist and develop that teacher training component.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.6.0}

I have submitted legislation that looks at providing tax credits for
teachers who purchase lap top computers and other technology. And I know
other members have focused on this concept, as well as the tuition tax
credits, to go back and get the kind of education that you need.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.7.0}

And also looking at corporate America, in terms of not wanting to thwart
any efforts that are currently going on altruistically in terms of
donating time, and hours, and buddying up with school systems, but also
providing a tax incentive there for businesses to seek and make sure
that they are assisting creating that workforce of the 21st Century that
we so vitally need.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.8.0}

But I come to, though I concur with Mr. Spoon about the importance of
having that hands-on, there can be no high tech without the high touch
of a professionally trained teacher within the context of a classroom.
There can be no furtherance of education if we do not use, as you point
out, tools to be more diagnostic in our approach, to be more
prescriptive with our remedies, and ultimately to be in a position that
technology will provide us, as Ms. Morella often says, to be able to
individualize instruction.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.9.0}

Now, you are Dr. Fallon or you are Dr. Glowa. And you are in a school
system. And you are talking about what is the best
means[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.0.0}[ of us getting that
technology into the classroom in a universal sense, recognizing that
what is right for Hartford may not be right for Hebron, or what is right
for Connecticut may not be right for California[?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.1.0}

Is it broad-band width? Is it radio wave? Is it infrared? Is it
satellite connections? The question that I am seeking to have our
experts and the people at NSF grapple with and answer in the business
community is, how do we in a most cost effective means provide our
superintendents of schools, our school systems, with the infrastructure
that they are going to need to carry this out?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.2.0}

And my concern here is two-fold. One, I think that we are being
leap-frogged with our own technology by other nations. That is number
one. And number two, a point that Dr. Fallon makes about maintenance.
How can any superintendent of schools plan today initiating no matter
how robust, as Dr. Fallon points out, a system that could be obsolete
under Morris Law in 6 to 12 months?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.3.0}

And with, if you will follow Morris Law to conclusion, and at the rate
of which technology is changing, without federal intervention, without
the collective academic, business, and governmental sectors coming
together, I do not see how school systems continue to make these kinds
of decisions without bankrupting themselves locally, or getting turned
away when they go to bonding referendums.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.4.0}

What would be your thoughts on that? I will start with Dr. Strawn and
work down.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.5.0}

Dr. STRAWN. Well, I agree with what you have said. And the need to
understand the technology, to find out what is the most effective and
efficient way to utilize means of bringing the technology into the
classroom is extremely important, since it involves major amounts of
dollars and cents. I might parenthetically add, I have to disagree with
what Mr. Spoon said about teachers not having time.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.6.0}

My observation is most public school teachers have at least 6 hours a
day that they can learn this stuff, between midnight and 6:00 a.m. [I
]{style="font-style:italic;"}would also mention that we are doing what
we can at the NSF to help obsolete any studies that we might make about
the efficiencies of information technology right now by seeing what we
can do to make it 100 times faster, 100 times cheaper, and 100 times
easier to use.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.7.0}

In so far as the researchers we support are successful in those three
important dimensions. We will simply put more emphasis on those 6 hours
that public school teachers have between midnight and 6:00 a.m. to learn
even more available and effective technologies.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.8.0}

Mr. SPOON. You ask a very difficult and important question. What do you
attack first[? ]{style="font-style:italic;"}Infrastructure, training,
and if you apply the shrinking cycle time of new chapters of technology,
with the more constant cycle time of people coming up to speed in
learning new talents and skills. We could be through three generations
of technology before we are a generation of teachers comfortable in
using what has since passed.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.9.0}

I think our view is getting faculty, addressing just instructional
faculty for the moment, not maintenance because that is a significant
issue as well, comfortable with the possibilities, and the
di[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.0.0}[mension of, and the
capabilities, and the evolutionary possibilities of technology will make
them better able to cope with future cycle

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.1.0}

You have to cut into that circle sooner than later. Better to skip a
cycle of technology and to have more adoption and utilization of
existing platforms that are very powerful and under-utilized, than to
get invested in the hardware and the infrastructure without having
addressed making faculty comfortable in knowing how to drive the latest
car with the latest dashboard.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.2.0}

Because the fact is when you buy that latest car, you are able to figure
out eventually how to use the dashboard because you have seen one of
those before. But if you do not have any idea which is the front of the
car and what the steering wheel is, it is intimidating, whether it is an
old technology model or a new one.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.3.0}

So, the advocacy here is let us accelerate adoption and comfort at all
levels of the system, going back to the teachers\' colleges, going back
to licensor on entry, going back to commitments on professional training
ongoing, and giving support for best practices and clearing houses so
that the champions, you know, can make not a 3-year adoption phase to 50
percent of the faculty, but can do it in the course of 18 months. There
are even examples in our report of where, there are two examples that
are worth noting.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.4.0}

One is a system in the Midwest that is using the kids to teach the
teachers because they are ahead of the line and recognizing the kids as
a resource. The other is a pyramid scheme. We know we do not like those
phrases, but the program is called Tag Team Approach, where every
teacher has an obligation to find yet another one, and pass along what
they just learned from the last one, and what they could add to it.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.5.0}

It is a way of mushrooming. I am not answering the difficult question
that you raised about getting up to speed to support all of this, but I
think cutting into the hardware and technology cycle is an appropriate
way to get established to handle the change that lies ahead.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.6.0}

from Oregon, and on this side of the aisle, Mr. Ehlers. Incidently,
today is World Standards Day. I also wanted to, people get hazy when
they think of standards, but they are critically important. And this

out that Mr. Ehlers this morning is recognized by the Science Coalition

I also have to comment that it is perfectly appropriate for you to Chair

questions because I was at other meetings and I missed the testimony.

But being a Title X-professor, I cannot resist making a few comments.
Just based on what I have heard during the short time here, it fits into
the format of what I think is the problem. And that is finding,
training, and keeping good teachers. And a very important part of that
is not just recruiting new ones, and

and keeping them, but also good professional development programs.

And that is one reason I have been fighting very hard and I have been
joined at that by Mr. Wu in the Education Committee, fighting hard to
keep the Eisenhower Professional Development Program and keep it going.
I would also very much like to see in the future, NSF expanding

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.2.0}

the summer institutes, which it has had for many years.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.3.0}

And which, if I am not mistaken, have been reduced from the hey day of
the 1970s. And I think that is a very effective means of keeping the
teachers current with respect to using technology in the classroom. So,
I hope my personal feeling, as apparent from that, the emphasis has to
be on the teacher.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.4.0}

Mr. Larson has observed the importance of the teacher, and the care of
the child, and the interaction of the child. But also, we have to
recognize our responsibility. And states have to recognize their
responsibility. And especially local school systems have to recognize
their responsibility to their teachers in terms of professional
training, professional development to keep up with the field.

same time, we have a substantial engineer work for us which is

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.6.0}

Is it impossible for us to train those teachers to handle the modern day
workplace? Is it impossible for them to learn that? I do not know the
answer, but I suspect that it might be more beneficial if we have
programs to get them trained, rather than just expanding the number of
H1B Visas. And the same thing with teachers.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.7.0}

We tend to give up too readily, I think, on teachers who simply say, oh,
I cannot do that, when in fact what they need is 4 week\'s to be shown
that not only can they do it, but they can do it far better than they or
anyone else thought. So, I hope we keep that in mind. If anyone wants to
respond briefly, that is fine, but I am just delivering my usual sermon.
Any comments?

Chairwoman MORELLA. I think that means total agreement, I mean as
someone who has been a professor.

Mr. EHLERS. Yes. Let the record show that there heads were nodding up

It appears to me that our challenges are great and deep when it comes to
bringing technology to the classroom. I mean, not only modern equipment,
modern software, we are talking about equipment and software that, like
a piece of fruit, rots. And as soon as we get it, it is getting old.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.14.0}

But I see our challenge also is teaching our staff so that they can use
the technology to teach, our administrators so they can use

technology to manage, our students so they can use technology to learn
to create, to research, and also to communicate.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.1.0}

But there is something that we have not been talking about. And that is,
and I will get to my question. And my question is should we not be
bringing technology to the classroom so that our students can
troubleshoot and repair the systems? They can build printed circuit
boards, even simple ones. Possibly, they can design
software[/]{style="font-style:italic;"}hardware programs so that when
they leave high school, get ready for college, or to go into the
workforce, they actually understand technology from many different
angles.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.2.0}

Just a few years ago, there was a survey on the jobs that paid a good
liveable wage that were not being filled in this Country, that were not
college jobs. One of them is a mechanic. Open the hood of a car, you
have to know electronics in order to be a mechanic these days.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.3.0}

So, will you talk to the possibility of expanding beyond using
technology in order, you know, versus understanding technology[?
]{style="font-style:italic;"}Let us start down here with Dr. Fallon.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.4.0}

Dr. FALLON. One of the comments I would make immediately is we have an
alternative high school, which is Synergy. It is grade 9 through 12, for
those students who have difficulty in a large high school. Three of
those students, when they graduated last year, they now have their own
technology company.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.5.0}

Ms. WOOLSEY. There you go.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.6.0}

Mr. FALLON. And they, I might add, not that I make a tremendous amount
of money, but each of them at the age of 19 is making considerably more
money than I will ever think of making. They were very involved at
Synergy, in terms of the maintenance of the equipment, et cetera.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.7.0}

Believe it or not, they learned all of that from a custodian that we
have at Synergy who is a technology wiz. And so things like that are
happening. There are a couple of other districts that have a number of
students, and they teach them around the freshman and sophomore years.
And they serve in terms of the maintenance.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.8.0}

The problem we have in East Hartford is there is a point at which we
have probably five or six people that can deal with the maintenance. But
when we start getting more sophisticated, that is where we are
fortunate. We bring the people from, I keep mentioning UTC, but they
have been fabulous. We bring their experts in, and they pretty much
recommend things to us.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.9.0}

So, that is the advantage you have with the corporations and their
involvement. I might also point out very quickly, we are very involved
with the corporate world because we have the School-Business
Partnership. And we have everyone that has anything to do with East
Hartford involved with us. That is a tremendous assistance for our
district.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.10.0}

Ms. WOOLSEY. Create partnership.\
Dr. FALLON. I just wanted to say that. Thank you.\
Ms. WOOLSEY. Absolutely.\
Ms. JOHNSON. Would the gentle lady yield for just one moment.\
Ms. WOOLSEY. Sure.\

Ms. JOHNSON. Well, you mentioned that they are making more than you. And
I think when teachers graduate, well-skilled from college, they usually
will go where the job is going to be the most lucrative. And I think we
are losing a lot of prepared people to the private industry right away
because they can start making more than a seasoned teacher in that
industry. And are we doing anything to try to see how we can level this?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.2.0}

Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, if the gentle woman will lead-maybe we could they
answer that on the second round of questions? I really want to know what
they think about bring youth, having them build in program.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.3.0}

Dr. GLOWA[. ]{style="font-style:italic;"}We have been approaching it in
two different ways. One is a formalized way through course work. [We
]{style="font-style:italic;"}have computer science classes that not only
deal with programming in C-plus-plus, but they also deal with rebuilding
computers, building computer networks. One of our partnerships is with
Cisco. So, that we actually teach Cisco classes.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.4.0}

People will come out as certified Cisco. We are exploring the same thing
with AAA certification and have Microsoft approaching us for the same
kind of thing. So that when students graduate from high school, they
graduate with those certifications.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.5.0}

Ms. Woolsey. Because I am going to run out of time, and you are
answering my questions, and I am feeling good about what you are doing.
I would like to ask the two gentlemen, what do you think about
bringing---we are talking about teachers not liking technology. Guess
what? Most elementary teachers and most teachers in general are female.
How are we going to break this circle, okay[?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.6.0}

Mr. STRAWN. Well, I strongly support what I believe you said earlier
about starting early in the pipeline. If we start at college or even
high school, we have probably missed the boat already.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.7.0}

Ms. WOOLSEY. Yes.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.8.0}

Mr. STRAWN. We need to get the grade school girls enthusiastic, get them
going, as I believe was said, or staying in the track of information
technology, mathematical skills, quantitative skills. We need to find
computer games that are not boring to little girls so that they will be
brought in.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.9.0}

Ms. WOOLSEY. There you go. Mr. STRAWN. That probably emphasize language
and other types of things which girls have a natural advantage in over
most boys. And I think the Web offers a good chance of that, since there
are many language-related skills and artistic activities which also
girls have very, very strong traditions of strength in. I think we can
do it, if we start early enough. Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you.

Chairwoman MORELLA. That means we are going to be voting. We have 15
minutes before we vote. But you know, apropos of what has been stated, I
talked to some of the teachers in Montgomery County Schools. And, you
know, I said, what is it that you need? Obviously you know some of the
answers. But one of the points that was brought out is that when we have
problems with our computers, we have nobody on hand to repair them.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.7.0}

We have to call a company. We have to wait for them to come out. If we
could just have some internal mechanism where somebody knows how to
repair it right, who is right there. Dr. Glowa,

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.8.0}

heard that or do we have something that addresses that concern?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.9.0}

Dr. GLOWA. It is the same point that Dr. Fallon was talking about, in
terms of technological support for computers. We have, at the secondary
level, a User Support Specialist in every school, which is a person

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.10.0}

Chairwoman MORELLA. You have somebody in every school?

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.11.0}

Dr. GLOWA. At the secondary level, we have a User Support Specialist in
every school. At the elementary, as we are building out the global
access, we are trying to build that support in. But it is one User
Support Specialist for every five schools. So, building in that, what we
call a part of our infrastructure, to support the equipment in the
buildings is absolutely essential, and it is a great frustration.

Chairwoman MORELLA[. ]{style="font-style:italic;"}[I

WU Dr. Strawn, as you alluded to, school teachers have all of the time
in the world from midnight until 6:00 a.m. to bone-up on technology. It
has been found in the private sector that just grabbing at some numbers,
that it cost \$5,000 to put a computer, and software, and the wiring on
a desk. It may cost \$35,000 to get folks adequately trained-up and

It is my impression that the same phenomenon occurs in the classroom for
teachers. H.R. 2417, the Education Technology Extension Act, would
establish an extension service to provide assistance to K-12 teachers
and schools to integrate their existing educational technologies into
their curriculum, as well as providing advice on new education
technologies.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.1.0}

This is modeled on the successful Agricultural Extension Programs, and
the successful Manufacturing Extension Programs to help with
manufacturing technologies. I might add that the proposed Education
Technology Extension Program is voluntary. A school district would
participate or not, depending on their perceived needs. I would like the
panel to have a chance to comment on this proposed program, before we
have to dash off and vote.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.2.0}

Mr. STRAWN. I am not only a believer in that idea, I am also a former
practitioner in my previous life at Research University. I attempted to
put together, and did put together, and operated a facility much like
that to help assist public education in our State. So, I have seen it
work. I think it can work, and NSF would be happy to work with you to
pursue that interesting and important idea.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.3.0}

Mr. SPOON. The idea has a lot of appeal to me. I would urge that there
be an element of mobility built into it, given the distances of schools
strewn about districts and states, and that staffing in those kinds of
clearing houses is plugged into classroom experience directly, carrying
ideas from place-to-place, experience from place-toplace with the
credibility of having been in the classroom, as opposed to being an
administrative help desk at a distance, you know, offering opinions from
on high.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.4.0}

Dr. GLOWA. Having that kind of support for school districts that do not
have an internal capacity would be wonderful, I would have to echo. One
of the things we have not talked about here is what needs to happen in
the curriculum to support technology. And that is absolutely core.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.5.0}

If your curriculum documents and assessments do not support the use of
technology, teaching people to use what is not part of the curriculum is
not beneficial. So, any kind of advisory group needs to keep that in
mind and have that experience.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.6.0}

Dr. FALLON. I need to, or I do not need to, but I certainly would concur
in terms of the comments just made by my colleague, to the right, in
terms of the entire issue of curriculum. If we are not integrating
technology in the curriculum, et cetera, then we are not succeeding in
doing what we should be doing. That is just the beginning, in terms of
now.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.7.0}

We are not there yet, very honestly. I think it is going to be a couple
of years before. The other issue that we have, in terms of curriculum, I
just share this with you, is our teachers are beginning more and more to
use the Internet, in terms of their lesson plans, et cetera.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.8.0}

That, as we all know, is additional time to their very busy schedule.
And you have heard from all of us here on this particular panel, that
time is probably one of the most important things, as it is for everyone
in every particular position that they have.

[]{#content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.9.0}

Mr. Wu. And on that note, I would like to thank the panelists for their

In the midst of the recent push to incorporate more and more technology

while schools are using more and more learning technology, most use it
to automate learning rather than bring students unique learning
opportunities.

Overview\
Technology availability is improving. During the\
last year, the number of computers in American\
schools increased 15 percent to create an\
installed huse of 6 million computers. While\
the increase is encouraging, it is important to\
note that the technology available outside\
school walls is ofen several generations ahcad\
of the technology available inside school walls.\
For example, il 11:1, che studentocomputer\
ratio for \"rop of the line\" machincs is twice as\
high as the national average sandent-e-comput-\
en rato for less sophisticated machines.\

In three years, from the fall of 1994 to the fall of 1997, che percent
age of U.S. public schools wi:h Internet access increased from \$5
percent to 78 percent.\" The number of schools with five or morc
classrcoms with Internet access increased from 25 percent of all schools
in the fall of 1996 to 43 percent of all schowls in the fall of 1997:
During 1997 and 1998, schools spen: an average of \$30.98 per student on

jobs with the highese growth potential between now and the year 2005 and
only eight do not require technologi cal fluency. None of the cight
currently pays more than twice the minimum wage.\*\* Moreover, it is
estimated that 60 percent of the jobs available at the beginning of the
next cenarry will require skills currently held by only 20 percent of
the workforce." In addition, the demand for workers to fill higher
skilled informacion technology jobs is likely to grow from 874,000 in
1996 to 1.8 million in 2006.\* Finally, higher skill jobs have higher
wages. Overall, compensacion in elite jobs grew 2.5 times faster than
compensation in blue-collar occupations, and 4.3 times faster than in
service occupations between 1987 and 1996.

More than ever before, employers in all industries are demanding that
their employees have basic technology skills and skills enabled by the
use of technology. As far back as 1991, the Secretary of Labor\'s
Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) articulated five areas
(see sidebar) in which students must be competent, and therefore schools
must reach, for the future.\* Today, the skills most often called for
are essentially the sarac: that studenus are cechnologically flueny,
that they learn how to learn, and that they can use technology to
communicate, collaborate, and support cridcal thinking and creative
problem solving.\*

Future Teachers Better preparing teachers is not a challenge that begins
with the teachers already in the classroom; it begins earlier. Over the

Pre-Service Programs Definition: The professional preparation of
teachers has traditionally occurred through four or five-year programs
administered by cot leges of education at instiwtions of higher
education. These programs typically integrate the stucty of subject
matter, student development, and teaching methods. They usually also
include a supervised clinical cxperience often referred to as \"studem

as the teachers and students evolve, decreasing dependense on school
administrators and the in-house computer expert Es teacher and student
know edge, needs, and comfort increases. Young, a former tracher at the
school, reports that until recently, even some of the teachers in this
technology rich school viewed technology as inevitable, as something
they had to accept. Now, he says teachers are beginning to see the
possibilities for themselves. \"Our goal is to create an envt. ronment
that encourages teachers to explore, leam, and deternine what\'s best
for them and their students in any given circumstance. We want our teach
ers to know enough about using technology that they can take the lead in

the effecus on student performance. The tech\
nology itself can enable them to share best\
practices and mentor one another. To accom-\
plish this, however, requires a move away from\
\"one-shot\" training. It also requires processional\
development with rechsology for those making\
decisions in schools and requires giving a voice\
in direction, planning, and implementation to\
teachers with technical expertise and hands-on\
experience using techrology in teach.\

[]{#content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.1.0}

It also requires making time for professiona:\
development with technology. Teachers in our\
nation\'s K-12 schools work an average of 45\
hours per week with 38 of those hours spent at\
school. Of the remaining 12 bours, teachers\
spend slightly more than three on activities\
involving studenus and almost nine on other\
teaching-related activities." It is no surprise,\
therefore, that more than 50 percent of\
school sill allow technology professional\
development to be optional. Consequenůy,\
many dedicated educators sacrifice their per-\
sonal time to learn about technology. While\
teachers should always share responsibility for\
their own professional developmen, primarily\
relying on teacher personal time will never\
enable a culture of effective technology use.\
Self-directed training should supplement, not\

tinuous professional development.\

Meeting Individual Teacher Needs: The Teacher Technology Adoption
Process To be effective, professional development programs need to
accommoodate the programa goals of the institution, the targeted results
for students, the level of sophistication of teachers who participate,
and the technology available. Since teachers are the linchpins of
success for students, their individual requirements for mastering new
methods, knowledge, and techniques deserve particular attention.

[]{#content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.3.0}

Experience suggests that teachers, even those most enthusiasuc about
teaching with technolon gy, typically pass through several disunct
stages before they becomc education technology integrators and
innovators. Progression through stages of technology adoption and
integration is not unique to the education community.\" For decades,
corporate America has witnessed a sim

progression as businesses have increased the presence and use of
technology, first for internal

[]{#content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.5.0}

I operations and then for interactions with vendors and customers
Corporate researchers also have identified a cycle of technology
integration that progresses through planning, investigacion, and
experimentation stages to the emergence of new work and organization
models.\* Though not identical to the stages of teacher technology
adoption described here, they are similar enough to suggest that
technology integration, ao matter where it occurs, is a process that
evolves over time.

Technology: A Professional Development Tool for Technology Professionals
Al Lucent Technologies, keeping a dispersed team of professionals
current on the technologies they service is a formidable challenge. To
meet the challenge, the company created the Call Center Institute (CCI),
an online resource center and knowledge warehouse accessible at any
time, from anywhere. The CCI is home to more than 800 megabytes of
information on current call center technolo gies and applications in the
form of case studies, white papers, research articles, training
materials, presentations, demonstrations and performance support tools.
Not only can Call Center Specialists access the vast array of infor.
mation through CCI; they can access each other. Whether sharing ideas,
experiences, or best practices, the CCI\'s Infor. mal chat rooms,
synchronous interactive teleconferencing programs, web-based seminars,
and \"telecollaboration consultations\" with product engineers help this
worldwide team stay current and connected. For more information about
CCI, contact Alan Chute, Director, Lucent Technologies Center for

1 Setting Goals and Meeting them Diane Hathaway, Principal of
Philadelphia\'s Hi-Freedman Middle Schoul, knew that making her school
\"Target Tech\" would require clear objectives and hard kort. The school
lacked bott, a computer cluster and a computer teacher. She would have
to serve simutaneously as principai, com. puter teacher, and repair
woman. Nevertheless, under Hathaway\'s guidance, \"mini-clusters of
leas: six compute\'s and to printers were located in every instructional
classroom. All school personnel trom teachers to custodians meceived
training a: the district training center. Over a period of a year and a
half, every available inservice day was devoted to technology training.
To ensure that teachers used their training. Hathaway decided to accepe
lesson plans only by email. posted caily ar..nounce menos cactusively on
the Internet, and evaluated teaches on their use of technology. www

7 Involving teachers in Planning The technology committee fo: tine
Chitienden South Supervisory District in Hinesburg, Vermont plans and
implements technology use in all district schools. The committee,
composed of fifteen teach. ers and media specialists and an assistant
superintender!, functions as both a de facto decision-making body and a
forum for sharing ir.or. mation among the district\'s schools. In
addition, the committee\'s meetings function as informat ir service time
for the members, providing ther, with new knowedge and skills to bring
back to their home schools. There, they serve on local technology
comrait. recs and field suggestions and questions from their colleagues.

effective than learning by doing. By creating an environment nology
through pradical experience, institutions can begin to see benefits
quickly. Teachers should use technologies such as distance learning,
online networking, and wet and computer-based classes to xcess
professional development resources. They should also use technology to
communicate and exchange Ideas with peers locally and around the globe.
Similarly, students should be encouraged to learn by doing and to share
new knowledge with peers.

4 Faculty First at lowa State towa State University made a conscious
decision to ctegrate lechrology tools into its educationa! Curriculur.
Before teaching stu. dents however, faculty lead to come first. In 1992,
.owa State estab. lished a rentoring program ier undergraduate anc
graduate students to mentor faculty members sonut technology. Ann
Thompson, Director, Center for Technology in Learning and Teaching at
lovit Siale University, says that the program allowed faculty members to
weave technology into projects of interest is a non trcatering way.
Based on lowa Ska:e survey data abolt tac.slty attitudes toward
rechnology, faculty member self-confidence with technology has gown
since the program began. lowa Stale also offers a minor in dua tional
computing through its school 9! education. Enrolment is now a: 150
slurlents, a 100 percent increase in two years. Iowa State works w:17
the University of Virginia and University of Exeter in inglars in the
Coattion to nnoration in Technology and Teacher Education (CITTE). C:ITE
desires visions for appropria:c technology use in the classroom and
produces videcs and demon. strations on the ettective classroom use of
technology. For more infor mation, contac: Ana Thompson, cat@iestate.edu

4 Pyramid to Success Imagine a school where 100 percent of teachers are
voluntarily active in technology training. Does it seem improbable? It
did to Dr. Carol Utay of Jessamine County until she began the \"Tag
Team\" program at Warner Elementary Schoo., The Tag Team works according
to a sin.ple pyramid scheme. \'nitially, a smali group of teachers was
offered train. ing on the condition that they use their training to
create a technolosy-infused project with a teache? nto nad 1:o:ye: been

impressive. Through the Tag Team program, all teachers at Warner
Elementary are involved in technol. ogy training. Teachers knox that
when they join the tag tean they will be inunlved in authentic projects

Year 2 Summary Overall, the assessment shows that schools are · making
gains. In fact, schools gained in all four STaR categories. The number
of schook effectively integrating technology increased from 15 percent
to 24 percent while the percentage of schools in the Low to Mid Tech
range decreased from 85 percent of schools to 76 percent of schools.
Specifically, the percenage of Target Tech schools doubled from three to
Eix percent while the percentage of High Tech schools increased by half.
Simultaneously, the percentage of Low Tech schools decreased by five
percentage points. Despite auch encouraging progress, more than 75

Background In 1997, the CEO Forum established a baseline measure against
which to track the progress of Anerican schools in inte grating
technology and technology use la class. rooms nationwide. This school
technology and readiness assessment, called the Star Assessment, offered
a soapshot of where the nation stood In its effort to integrate
technology in education to improve academic standards and student
achievement. Following up on its commitment to issue an annual update of
the STaR Assessment, this section of this report summarizes the Year 2
STaR Assessment of the CEO Forum. Again this year, the STaR Assessment
is primarity based on hardware and connectivity data collected as part
of a survey of the nation\'s public schools. The Star Assessment uses
the CEO Forum Star Chart as a backdrop to Hlustrate how our schools are
doing.

[]{#content-0065.xml#GBS.PA93.w.17.1.0}

These trends, and the information on the following pages, indicate that
more students have greater access to better technology than they did
last year. More students have access to multimedia computers and the
instructional rooms at more schools have connections to the Internet.
Although schools continue to make progress in building hardware
infrastructures, commitment to cacher professional develop ment with
technology bags behind. As schools continue to put more connected
computers into classrooms, the CEO Foram hopes chat educa ions and
policymakers will follow the recommendations in this report To make the
most of our radonal investment in education technology, we nust ensure
that teachers are well prepared to guide today\'s students to future
success

About this Book - From Google

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on
library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a
project to make the world\'s books discoverable online. It has survived
long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public
domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject to copyright
or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the
public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books are our
gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and
knowledge that\'s often difficult to discover. Marks, notations and
other marginalia present in the original volume may appear in this
file - a reminder of this book\'s long journey from the publisher to a
library and finally to you.

Google Book Search has digitized millions of physical books and made
them available online at the Google Books web site. The digitization at
the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books. To
make this book available as an ePub formated file we have taken those
page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition
(or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page images
is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books\' pages,
fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the
extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the
ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to
extracted-text based books. Our computer algorithms also have to
automatically determine the structure of the book (what are the headers
and footers, where images are placed, whether text is verse or prose,
and so forth). Getting this right allows us to render the book in a way
that follows the format of the original book.

Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes, garbage
characters, extraneous images, or missing pages in this book. Based on
our estimates, these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the
content of the book. The technical challenges of automatically
constructing a perfect book are daunting, but we continue to make
enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies.

We hope you\'ll enjoy these books as much as we do.

Usage guidelines

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain
materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to
the public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work
is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken
steps to prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing
technical restrictions on automated querying.

We also ask that you:

-   *Make non-commercial use of the files:* We designed Google Book
    Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these
    files for personal, non-commercial purposes.
-   *Refrain from automated querying:* Do not send automated queries of
    any sort to Google\'s system: If you are conducting research on
    machine translation, optical character recognition or other areas
    where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact
    us. We encourage the use of public domain materials for these
    purposes and may be able to help.
-   *Maintain attribution:* The Google \"watermark\" you see on each
    file is essential for informing people about this project and
    helping them find additional materials through Google Book Search.
    Please do not remove it.
-   *Keep it legal:* Whatever your use, remember that you are
    responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not
    assume that just because we believe a book is in the public domain
    for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public
    domain for users in other countries. Whether a book is still in
    copyright varies from country to country, and we can\'t offer
    guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is
    allowed. Please do not assume that a book\'s appearance in Google
    Book Search means it can be used in any manner anywhere in the
    world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.
