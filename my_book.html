<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. I will call the joint hearing to order. I want to
welcome all of you to the joint hearing with the Basic Research
Subcommittee on the topic of Overcoming Barriers to the Utilization of
Technology in the Classroom.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Today's rapid advancement and technological development has opened us
all up to a new and exciting world that, just a few short years ago,
seemed unimaginable. With the click of a mouse, technology continues to
change the way we live, learn, work, and interact each and every
day.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Perhaps, in no other area do we hope to benefit more from the influx
of technology in our society than in our Nation's educational system.
Successful integration of technology in our schools has the potential to
transform the way our children learn, creating new and challenging
opportunities to enhance their academic perform</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Students in today's connected classroom are no longer bound,
physically, by the bricks and mortar that surround them. Instead, they
have at their fingertips the opportunity to explore the world and take
in vast amounts of information along the way. We are only just beginning
to realize the potential of technology in helping to improve student
learning and increase academic performance.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>And with new technologies being developed at lightening speed, we can
only imagine the promise it holds for the future. Yet, as we approach
the beginning of the 21st Century, many schools have been slow to
implement a technology-rich learning environment that is crucial for
tackling the challenges of the next millennium.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA1.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>According to a recent report prepared by the CEO Forum on Education
and Technology, represented today by Mr. Spoon, only 6 percent of our
Nation's schools are at the leading edge or effectively integrating
technology into the classroom. More importantly, the report noted that
over half of our Nation's schools were considered</p>

<div id="content-0004.xml#block.5.1.0.box.216.304.1774.3016.q.101"

<p>"low technology” or having limited access, if any at all, to mostly
outdated computer equipment.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>We know there are barriers that schools face in seeking to integrate
technology into their curriculum. The costs associated with developing
technology savvy in schools are significant. And schools must
increasingly weigh the benefits of investing in technology against other
competing priorities, such as school maintenance, construction, and the
hiring of new teachers.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>To-date, the Federal Government has been heavily involved in helping
schools integrate technology into the classroom. The General Accounting
Office has estimated that at least 27 federal programs provide funding
that may be used to purchase, among other things, technologies for
schools and libraries.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Yet, despite this significant federal investment in educational
technology and the promise it holds for our youth, it is clear that
computers, alone, cannot improve our Nation's school systems. Used
incorrectly, technology can become a very expensive babysitter,
providing little benefit, while stripping schools and districts of
scarce resources.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>I continue to believe that the classroom teacher is the key, the key
to bringing technology into our schools. Many educators simply do not
have the training necessary to successfully implement the use of
technology in their curriculum in a meaningful way.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>And the CEO Forum on Education and Technology found that only 20
percent of full-time public school teachers felt prepared to integrate
technology in a classroom; only 20 percent. To address the challenges
that schools face in implementing successful technology programs, last
February, I introduced H.R. 645, which is the Teacher Technology
Training Act.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>And that legislation would require states to incorporate technology
requirements in teacher training and content standards. The bill also
encourages schools, districts to include technology classes in their
programs, and colleges and universities to incorporate technology into
their education curriculum. Now, our hearing today will explore the
appropriate role of technology in K-12 education.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>We will look at the role of the Federal Government in helping schools
integrate technology into their classrooms in a meaningful way. And we
want to examine the barriers that schools face in implementing a
successful technology-rich learning environment, and what needs to be
done to help teachers and administrators overcome these obstacles.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Finally, we also need to talk about how the private sector can be
harnessed to assist schools in their technology programs. Large and
small businesses alike have a vested interest in ensuring students have
the skills they need to succeed in a workforce driven by the information
age. For unless we utilize classroom technology in a meaningful way, we
run the risk of graduating students who are really unprepared to succeed
in the 21st Century job market.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA2.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>So, the private sector certainly has a role to play. We have a very
distinguished panel of witnesses today. And I do look forward to their
testimony. It is now-it gives me great pleasure to yield to the Chairman
of the Basic Research Subcommittee, Mr. Nick Smith, for his opening
comments.</p>

<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3" class="page"></span>
<div id="content-0004.xml#block.6.1.0.box.220.306.1779.3022.q.101"
class="gtxt_body">
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.0.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Well, I also would certainly like to welcome our
panelists. And I thank the Chair of the Technology Subcommittee,
Representative Morella, for organizing this hearing. The topic certainly
is very important as we look for overcoming</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>barriers and assuring that the kind of technology that we can offer
today is constructive, in terms of the ultimate success of students in
their quest for learning.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Today's education technology offers students and teachers access to
astonishing amounts of information. And I would include in technology,
not only computer and the Web site, but our televisions through
satellite feeds. I noticed on my television, I can get three different
stations that totally dedicate themselves to motorcycles.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>So here, again, an insurmountable amount of information, in terms of
motorcycles. It is three more locations from our satellites on
motorcycles that I use. But, again, just to point out how much
information is out there. And so somehow educators, like our panelists
today, need to start assessing how we can utilize so much
information.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>And what is the reasonable limits of having that information
available to kids? And what is the proper balance where we have that
information, as opposed to teaching these children and having these
students learn how to think<span style="font-style:italic;">?
</span></p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>That ultimately is going to be a greater benefit to themselves, their
families, and this Country. I would suggest that the Federal Government
puts a lot of money into this issue, literally hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. And we hope to ensure that these programs are effective,
both educationally effective and cost effective.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>As most are aware, there have been concerns raised about how some
education technology initiatives, such as the ones involving the E-Rate
Tax, for example, have been funded and implemented, in terms of hooking
up these schools to the Internet. In terms of those schools that have
already taken the initiative of hooking up their schools to the
Internet, prior to the availability of this kind of money, have
sometimes been short-changed with this new program that government
offers with restrictive use for those particular funds.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>I would hope the panel today could address one of my concerns about
technology in the classroom, a concern I think others share. Namely, are
these computers in the classroom helping our children learn to think?
And how do we make that decision?</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Two schools in my District, schools that are fairly close to each
other geographically, and serve very similar communities, take two
totally different approaches to computers in the classroom.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>In one, computers are present in the school and available for
students to use, but only in designated computer labs. In the other
school, students have a series of computers in almost every classroom.
And as I walk to the back of some of these classrooms, students
sometimes are rapidly changing the programs that they might have on
their computer screens.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA3.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>And so, again, the challenges. And what we would look to you today,
as expert witnesses, is the proper balance and the effective use of
computers, with information technology such a vital part of tomorrow's
education. And what I would ask, Madam Chairman, is the rest of my
remarks be inserted into the record. And maybe I</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Without objection, so ordered.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.2.0"></span>
<p>Thank you for your opening statement, Mr. Chairman. I would now like
to recognize the Ranking Member of the Basic Research Subcommittee, Ms.
Eddie Bernice Johnson.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.3.0"></span>
<p>Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairman, and
Mr. Chairperson of the Basic Research. I am pleased to join my
colleagues in welcoming our witnesses today to this joint hearing of the
Technology and Basic Research Subcommittees on technology in the
classroom.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.4.0"></span>
<p>The promise of applications of new information technologies in the
schools is by now well known. Such possibilities as instruction tailored
to individual students, curriculum enriched through access to remote
educational resources, and to powerful new ways to visualize complex
information.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.5.0"></span>
<p>Knowledge of the most effective ways for using educational technology
is not yet available, nor in general have the effects on student
performance been quantified for applications of a particular technology.
However, enough evidence has been obtained, particularly from
experiments involving technology-rich schools with welltrained and
highly-motivated teachers, to drive interest and expanding the access of
schools through information technology.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.6.0"></span>
<p>The introduction of educational technology involves two major sets of
issues. The first revolves around the acquisition and maintenance of
computers and networks. This sounds simple. The reality is that while
some schools have new computers, too often, these same schools lack the
technology staff necessary to keep these computers operational.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.7.0"></span>
<p>The second major set of issues is the integration of technology into
actual classroom instruction. For both, educators and administrators
need information about options and best practices, and direct
assistance, and teacher preparation and guidance in the use of
educational software.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.8.0"></span>
<p>Today, we will review what federal efforts may assist schools in
using educational technology. In particular, we will discuss some
legislative ideas that have been advanced by our colleagues that address
specific aspects of the acquisition and effective use of technology.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.9.0"></span>
<p>I believe that the Federal Government can be a catalyst for
constructive change in our schools, if it is, if its relatively small
K12 education investment is wisely directed. I look forward to hearing
the views and recommendations of our witnesses on strategies that could
lead to more effective deployment and use of educational technology.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.10.0"></span>
<p>And I want to thank the joint Chairs for holding today's hearing on
this important topic. I appreciate the attendance of our witnesses, and
look forward to the discussion. Thank you.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.11.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA4.w.2.12.0"></span>
<p>We have Mr. Sherwood Boehlert from New York, a very distinguished man
interested in education, who is here, who said he had no opening
comment.</p>

<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.0.0"></span>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of the
Technology Subcommittee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Jim
Barcia.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Mr. BARCIA. Thank you, Chairwoman Morella.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>I want to join you, and Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Johnson,
and the Committee members in welcoming the witnesses, and everyone in
the audience to today's hearing. Technology in the classroom is one of
those perennial topics, which we have discussed for the past 50
years.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Back in the 1950s, filmstrips and movies were met with great
anticipation, as a means to improve the educational experience. In the
1980s, computers were regularly being used as an educational tool. And
in this decade, the Internet has become the latest technology to improve
education.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>While I believe we can all agree that these technology advances have
benefitted our students, in our zeal to put these technologies in a
classroom, we must also ensure that teachers, administrators, and
schools boards know how to best utilize their educational technology
investments. A February 1999 Department of Education Report, Teacher
Quality, a report on the preparation and qualification of public school
teachers, found that only 20 percent of teachers felt well-prepared to
work in modern classrooms. This was not a new finding. An Office of
Technology Assessment Report, Teachers and Technology: Making the
Connection, identified teacher training as the most critical, and
generally the most neglected element of edtech programs.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>H.R. 2534, introduced by my colleague, Mr. Larson, is a required step
in developing the policies to ensure that all schools are linked to the
Internet. In addition to Mr. Larson's efforts, earlier this year, Mr. Wu
and myself, introduced H.R. 2417, the Educational Technology Utilization
Extension Assistance Act.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>The goal of this legislation is simple: to improve the use of
educational technology in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms.
This bill creates Educational Technology Extension Centers to advise
K-12 teachers, administrators, and school boards on how to better
utilize their existing ed- tech investments, as well as providing advice
on new educational technology.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>I look forward to hearing the witnesses comment about these
Educational Technology Centers, as outlined in H.R. 2417. While I
believe that a need exists for these Centers, I want to stress that a
number of school districts already provide this type of support. For
example, in my hometown of Bay City, Michigan, the Bay Aroneck
Intermediate School District provided professional training for nearly
1,000 educators last year.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>This type of support is critical in providing teachers with the
skills they need to integrate the latest technologies in their
classrooms. Legislation, like H.R. 2534, complements these ongoing
efforts. In areas where this type of technical advice is not available,
H.R. 2417 would begin this important effort.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA5.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Given our rapidly changing economy, and increasingly global economic
competition, we need to provide our children with the best education
possible. Education technology can both enhance the students'
educational experience and provide them with valuable job skills. I
believe that both of these bills are a step in this direction.<span

<p>Chairwoman Morella. Thank you, Mr. Barcia.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Gee, we are overwhelmed with Michiganers here and they all do such a
great job. Mr. Boehlert, I recognize you, sir, for any comments you
would like to make.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Mr. BOEHLERT. Thank you. I want to provide some geographic balance,
so from the Northeast. I would like to commend both Chairs for calling
this hearing. I think it is extremely important. And I want to take
advantage of this opportunity to get on my soapbox once again.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>School boards across America are critically important. And I would
specifically direct it to Mr. Spoon to use the good offices of the great
Washington Post. And I would challenge editors, and publishers, and
people identified with such journals across the Nation to challenge
corporate America because here is what happens.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>When I have a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, or the National
Association of Manufacturers, or any other business-oriented group, they
constantly tell me about the government spending too much money, about
State Governments, Federal Government spending too much money. I listen
to them politely. And then I usually ask them a couple of questions.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>One, how many employees that you have are on school boards back in
their local communities? Then I usually ask them, how many of your
corporations have a day care policy? And the reason I do that is because
if the business community does not take a greater role in providing
inspired leadership, starting at the local level, there is going to be a
big void. And there is, in this instance, in terms of getting into the
21st Century with technology training.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>And if we want things to operate in a more professional businesslike
way, we have got to have more professional business people involved in
the decision-making starting at the local level. So, I would hope you
would take this on advisement and give some consideration.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>I would like to know, from the Fortune 500 companies, how many
employees of their respective companies are on school boards, because
they know how important this subject matter is? And the answer is too
few. So, I think there is a great opportunity for you and others so
situated to help in the cause. Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. I think the Subcommittees would both agree with
you, Mr. Boehlert. I am now pleased to recognize Mr. Larson from
Connecticut, who is one of the motivators for this joint hearing. Mr.
Larson.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Mr. LARSON. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA6.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>Let me thank my esteemed colleagues and distinguished witnesses for
being here. And I want to, again, thank Chairwoman Morella and Chairman
Smith, Ranking Members Barcia and Johnson for holding this hearing on
this very timely topic before us</p>

<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.0.0"></span>
<p>today. And I would request at the outset that the extent of my
remarks be inserted in the record, and will briefly summarize.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Without objection, so ordered.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. LARSON. The Department of Commerce came out with a report in July
9th of this year entitled Falling Through the Net. And it very
dramatically talked about the digital divide that is being created in
this country. The digital divide is happening along the lines of race,
gender, geographic location, and wealth.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.3.0"></span>
<p>And what they noted is that the problem is getting worse. And it is
not just a question of computers in the classroom. It is a question of
the total integration of voice, video, and data information, and how to
best utilize that. That creates a problem for a number of our public
school systems, because clearly, at least in my humble estimation, that
is where we have to resolve this specific issue.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.4.0"></span>
<p>And to do so, as was pointed out by Nick Smith, we have to address it
on several levels, one of which is teach training. And Chairwoman
Morella and Representative Stabenow have put together bills that I think
are vitally important and that I am a cosponsor of.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.5.0"></span>
<p>But also along the lines of teacher training, we have to address a
basic infrastructure concern from a technological standpoint. And that
infrastructure concern is how do we provide universal, ubiquitous
service so that all students have access to the information super
highway?</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.6.0"></span>
<p>And how do we come up with a means that is the most effective, and
the most efficient means of providing voice, video, and data
communication within the context of our schools, and that our teachers
can utilize in their daily lesson plans, and in their curriculums.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.7.0"></span>
<p>I am looking forward to the testimony here today. And I am delighted,
Madam Chairwoman, to have with us a dear friend, and an individual who I
have long been an admirer of, Dr. James Fallon, from East Hartford,
Connecticut, who is the Superintendent of Schools there.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.8.0"></span>
<p>And just very briefly, if I might, Madam Chairwoman, by way of going
forward. He has had a life-long commitment and involvement in the
education field. He has received his Bachelor's Degree in Education from
Westfield State College in Massachusetts. And he started teaching in the
8th grade in 1964 in East Hartford.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.9.0"></span>
<p>It was not long after that he_became an Assistant Superintendent,
excuse me, an Assistant Principal, a Principal, Assistant Superintendent
of Schools, and now currently the Superintendent of Schools of the East
Hartford Public School System.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.10.0"></span>
<p>In short, Jim has worked his way up and has a pragmatic, handon,
understanding. The Town of East Hartford, which also happens to be my
hometown, the schools that he administers comprise of nine elementary
schools, one middle school, and one high school, one alternative high
school, and one Special Education Transitional Program with
approximately 7,000 students, and an annual budget of approximately $57
million.</p>
<span id="content-0004.xml#GBS.PA7.w.2.11.0"></span>
<p>He also, at the high school, is unique in Connecticut of having over
57 different ethnic groups that matriculate at East Hartford High
School. He is on the Oversight and Comprehensive Professional
Development Plan for the East Hartford Board of Education,</p>

<p>Given the topic of today's hearing, I believe that he will provide a
unique perspective. And I thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for the
opportunity to introduce a dear friend and an esteemed colleague, Dr.
Jim Fallon.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Mr. Larson. And we certainly do
welcome Mr. Fallon as one of the people testifying. <span

see, Ms. Rivers, I know, was here. And Ms. Woolsey, from California, for
any comments.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.3.0"></span>

</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Ms. </span>WOOLSEY. You are welcome.
There is nothing more frustrating than being here before somebody else
and then getting preempted. I know. Listen, thank you very much, the
Chairs and the Ranking Members, for this panel we are going to hear this
afternoon. I am one of the few members in the House of Representatives
on both the Science Committee and the Education Committee.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>And it is crucial, I know that, from both Committees that we prepare
our young people for the 21st Century, and that we include technology in
all schools for all of our students. Otherwise, they just are not going
to be ready for the workforce in the next millennium. Because of that, I
have offered an amendment that was passed by the Committee.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>My amendment allows the National Science Foundation to review how
schools are using technology. And making sure that they use it to the
best of their abilities, and that they can share the information between
schools so that everybody is not constantly reinventing the wheel.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>And I know that is important because we do not want to start over
every time we have a school that decides technology is important. But we
all do know that technology and education is crucial. One of the other
barriers that I am concentrating on in both Committees and here in the
House is the question of why young girls decide, by 9th grade, that they
are not interested in science, math, and technology<span
style="font-style:italic;">? </span></p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>So, I have a bill called “Go Girl” that will mentor and encourage
young girls from the 4th grade on, so that they stay with science, math,
and technology, stay interested, see the value of it, and make sure that
we have a full workforce, not just 50 percent of the brilliant people in
the country, but 100 percent having choices in the use of technology</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA8.w.1.12.0"></span>
<p>I want to hear from you. You are the experts. And I look forward to
your testimony. Thank you.</p>

share with us some recommendations on how we can better prepare teachers
to integrate technology in a classroom.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Also joined by Dr. Elizabeth Glowa. She is the Director for
Instructional Technology Support Team, the Office of Global Access
Technology at the Montgomery County, Maryland Public Schools; great,
great school system. Montgomery County is doing a wonderful job in the
area of educational technology. And she will share with us some key

<p>Finally, we welcome Mr. James Fallon, the Superintendent of the East
Hartford School District. Know your School District is also on the
leading edge of technology in the classroom. So, I would now ask the
panelists, since it is a policy of the Science Committee to swear in all
of those who will testify, if you will stand, raise your right hand.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>The report will indicate responses in the affirmative.<br />

Mr. Smith, other members of the Subcommittees, thank you very much for
the opportunity to testify here today. As Ms. Morella said, I am George
Strawn, Executive Officer of the Directorate for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering at the National Foundation, Science
Foundation.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA9.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Previously, I was Director of NSF's Division of Advanced Networking
Infrastructure and Research. I have been involved with information
technology since the early 1960s, and specifically with the Internet
since the early 1980s. Before coming to the National Science Foundation,
I spent most of my career at a research uni</p>

<p>versity, both as a computer science faculty member, and as a provider
of academic information service technologies.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>I would like to thank Mr. Larson, and the other members here today,
for their interest and support of educational information technology.
Having been involved with both education and information technology all
of my career, I strongly believe that information technology is in the
early stages of transforming how we learn, just as it is transforming
other important aspects of how we work and how we live.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>I think Mr. Smith asks an important question when he says, is it
transforming how we think? And is it assisting us to think better? And I
think the honest answer is we do not know yet. Us true believers think
so. As with other dimensions of information technology, sometimes it
takes awhile to verify our beliefs.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>I further believe that the U.S. citizens are well-served by such
Members of Congress as you, who clearly share a vision of the importance
of information technology. The National Science Foundation has been a
major force in the history of the Internet, as have other federal
agencies.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>From 1965 to 1985, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of
the Department of Defense carried out long-term research in computer
networking that resulted in the definition of and early implementations
of the Internet. From 1985 until 1995, the National Science Foundation
played a pivotal role by building the first and the second national high
performance Internet backbone networks. The first was built in 1988.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>The second in 1991. Of course, the definition of “high performance”
is constantly changing. Today, the NSF VBNS high performance network has
links that are about 2,000 times faster than the higher performance NSF
net of 1988. A part of NSF's contribution to the emergence of the
Internet that has much relevance to the proposed Science and Educational
Networking Act was our socalled Connections Program.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, we have estimated that NSF
assisted as many as 2,000 institutions of higher learning to connect to
the Internet. And beginning in 1996, we have also forwarded research and
development in novel technologies that could lower the cost of and<span
style="font-style:italic;">/</span>or lower other barriers to bringing
the Internet more quickly to public schools and libraries.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>I have a page or so of material that describes our partnering with
the private sector, but given time limitations, I would ask that you
refer to my written material for that.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>I mentioned since 1995, NSF and other federal agencies have been
participating in the Next Generation Internet Initiative, which has
accelerated advanced networking research, created high performance
networking test beds for the research community, and stimulated the
emergence of revolutionary science and engineering that require high
performance networking.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA10.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>The agencies participating in this so-called NGI Initiative have also
been working closely with the complementary Internet-II project, which
is a collaborative venture of more than 100 research universities who
are also pursuing advances in high performance networking</p>

<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.0.0"></span>
<p>As our previous and continuing activities indicate, NSF has been and
continues to be a leader in educational networking. We believe that the
time is approaching when lowered cost and increased ease of use of
Internet products and services will enable high performance networking
in all public schools and libraries.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>As you no doubt know, schools and libraries are currently being
connected to the Internet at a very rapid pace as a result of the E-Rate
Program. In the first year of the Program, 640,000 classrooms were
connected to the Internet. This year, $2.4 billion is available to
connect an expected 528,000 more classrooms. Eighty percent of
public</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>schools and 50 percent of public libraries participate in the E-Rate
Program. Some schools and libraries have already used E-Rate support for
high speed large band-width capacity connections. Given the success of
this Program, one way that we could add value is to encourage the
identification of best educational practices, to provide educators and
policy makers with tools for using existing and evolving Internet
technologies more effectively as a part of our educational strategy. An
often overlooked consideration in this discussion relates to resources
required to train teachers and provide the technical support to
effectively use Internet technologies in schools and libraries.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>These questions cannot be answered, given our current level of
understanding about using Internet as an educational tool. But I am, of
course, very pleased to hear about Ms. Morella's and others' activity in
this area to support additional teacher training in this area.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>The need to better understand costs, capabilities, human resource
requirements, potential educational benefits of universal high speed
Internet access to schools is clear. NSF stands ready to work with
Congressman Larson, and the committees, as well as other agencies with a
stake in educational technology to develop an effective mechanism to
inform policy makers in this rapidly evolving world of networking.</p>
<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA11.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on this important
matter. And I would be happy to try to answer any questions that you may
have.</p>

<span id="content-0007.xml#GBS.PA13.w.2.0.0"></span>
<p>One other important part of NSF's contribution to the creation of the
Internet involved the manner in which we partnered with private industry
during the 1985-1995 decade of development. Major telecommunications
providers including MCI, Sprint, and AT<span
style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span>T were partners with NSF during
this time as were major computer companies such as IBM. Also, the first
two private sector Internet Service Providers, UUnet and PSI, were
commercializations of networking activities that had been initiated by
NSF and other government agencies. Moreover, by enabling private sector
organizations to participate with universities and colleges in the
formation of regional networks, which attached to the NSFNET backbone,
very rapid transfer of technology to the private sector was set in
motion. By 1992 we were already planning our phased withdrawal from
Internet backbone network service provision, and in 1995 we were able to
"retire" the NSFNET and tum the entire backbone business over to the new
Internet industry.</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. You did a splendid job, also staying within the

entirety of your testimony will be included in the record. So, if you

<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>We are now pleased to hear from Mr. Alan Spoon.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. Madam Chairman, Chairman Smith, Congressman Barcia, other
members of the Committee, it really is an honor to be here today
representing the CEO Forum on Education and Technology. The CEO Forum is
a coalition of corporate and academic leaders who formed a 4-year
partnership to assess and monitor progress toward integrating technology
in American schools.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Our objective is to help ensure that our Nation's students will
achieve higher academic standards through enriched learning, and will be
equipped with the skills they need to be contributing citizens and
productive workers in the next Century. Our first Report on Hardware and
Connectivity, issued in late 1997, found that most schools lacked the
hardware and connections needed to truly benefit the students'
learning.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>While a majority of schools were connected to the Internet, in many
cases, it was a single connection, to a single computer, to be shared by
scores of students. The CEO Forum also developed what is now known as
the School Technology And Readiness or STAR Chart, a self-assessment
tool that schools can use to determine their level of technology
readiness.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>This tool has been sent to hundreds of school districts around the
Country, and received strong support from the K-12 community. The State
of North Carolina has even adopted the chart as its formal measure of
technology integration in schools Statewide.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Our year two report focused on the topic of professional development.
And I will have more to say about that in a moment. Our year three
report, due out in early 2000, will address the topic of digital content
and what broad-band delivery can contribute to the learning process.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>The year four report on outcomes and assessment will look at how
technology and integration can make a measurable difference in American
education. Since the CEO Forum began its work, the number of connected
schools has jumped dramatically, from 35 percent to, I am guessing,
nearly 100 percent today.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>The number of wired classrooms, per school, has also increased
substantially, and now stands at 43 or more percent. Encouraging as this
progress is, we found very few teachers who could integrate the new
technology into their curriculum. They are not being adequately trained
to do so, nor is the new generation of teachers.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>One-third of our schools of education believe that they are
illequipped to teach teachers to use technology effectively in the
classroom. More than half of the Nation's schools consider technology
training and education for teachers optional. Twenty-five states, the
number may have changed since, but 25 states as of the time of my
report, do not require a computer education for initial licensor.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA16.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Only two States, at the time of my report, North Carolina and
Vermont, require teaching candidates to demonstrate that they can use
technology. We also found the current spending on professional
development is inadequate; a false precision, but we found about<span

id="content-0011.xml#para.20.1.0.box.110.296.1776.178.q.101"
class="gtxt_body"> $5.65 per student, or 5 percent of overall school
technology budgets in the last school year, compared to $88 and change
for hardware, software, and connectivity.</span></p>

<div id="content-0011.xml#block.20.1.0.box.105.296.1781.3016.q.101"
class="gtxt_body">
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>We think professional development should claim approximately 30
percent of these budgets, mirroring our own level of such investment in
the business world, and the Department of Education agrees. Given all of
this, it is not surprising that just 20 percent of teachers felt, as you
have heard in opening remarks from many of you, 20 percent of teachers
felt they were well-prepared to integrate technology into classroom
instruction.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>This is not good enough. America's elementary and secondary schools
are likely to hire two million teachers over the next decade. Those
teachers simply must be able to apply the wonders of modern technology
in service of their students. In addition, the roughly three million
teachers already at work in our public schools must be trained to use
technology in the classroom as well.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>These teachers are responsible for equipping today's students for
tomorrow's workforce. Sixty percent of the jobs available, at the
beginning of the next Century, will require technology skills currently
held by only 20 percent of the workforce. That is a wide gap. And it
cannot be bridged without adequate professional development of America's
current, as well as future teachers.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Why is all of this so important? Because the greater use of
technology in education can, not only foster productive drill and
practice, but can lead as well to higher order of thinking, more
collaborative learning, and teamwork, greater use of information
resources, and ultimately the customization of learning that will end
forever the teacher's perineal imperative to teach to the middle.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>With a base level of technology and connections now embedded in
American schools, it is time to focus new attention, and energy, and
resources on ensuring that tomorrow's and today's teachers are prepared
to put technology to work in classrooms for the benefit of their
students.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>The CEO Forum on Education and Technology recommends the
following:</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>1. Schools of education should prepare new teachers to integrate
technology effectively into the curriculum. Accreditation standards,
faculty training, licensor and certification, and funding priorities
should all be reformed with this objective in mind.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>The CEO Forum will soon publish a Teacher Preparation STAR Chart to
help schools, colleges, and departments of education assess their_level
of technology readiness in preparing tomorrow's teachers. The chart
should be ready shortly after the first of the year. And it will be made
available to every school of education in America.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>2. Current teachers and administrators should be proficient in
integrating technology into curriculum. To accomplish this objective,
continuing education and proficiency standards should be strengthened.
Professional Development Programs should be updated. Technology access
and technology funding should be increased.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA17.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>3. Education policy makers and school administrators should create
systems that reward the integration of technology into the curriculum.
The means adjusting hiring standards, making teacher<span

<p>4. And last, corporations and local businesses should work with the
education community to help ensure that today's students will graduate
with 21st Century workplace skills that we have all talked about
already.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Among other things, and there are many, this means working with
colleges of education, as we have done for years with business schools,
to devise, and encourage, and help fund an effective real world
curriculum that demonstrates the power of technology-enhanced
teaching.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA18.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>So, the bottom line is clear, to improve the way teachers teach, the
way students learn, and the way students and schools perform, we need to
improve technology, professional development throughout a teacher's
career. The CEO Forum is committed to this work, and we are very
grateful for this Committee's commitment and leadership in this field,
as demonstrated by this important hearing today. Thank you.</p>

<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA19.w.7.0.0"></span>
<p>Toward this end, we agreed to produce four major reports on this
progress. Each report would be based on the four pillars of education
technology - hardware &amp; connectivity, professional development,
content, and outcomes &amp; assessments. These pillars are all essential
to improving student achievement through technology.</p>

<p>CEO Forum Reports Our first report on hardware and connectivity,
issued in late 1997, found very few K-12 schools in what we call the
Target Tech" category. Most schools lacked the hardware and connections
needed to truly impact students' learning. While a majority of schools
were connected to the Internet, for example, in many cases it was a
single connection to a single computer to be shared by hundreds of
students. As part of our first year's initiative, the CEO Forum also
developed what is now known as the "School Technology and Readiness
(STAR) Chart," which is a selfassessment tool schools can use to
determine their level of technology readiness across the four pillars.
This tool has received strong support from the K-12 community and the
state of North Carolina has even adopted the chart as its formal measure
of technology integration in schools statewide.</p>

you to know that our Year 3 report, which is currently underway and
expected to be complete in early 2000, will address the topic of
"Digital Content" and how new forms of content and delivery impact
learning. The Year 4 report on "Outcomes &amp; Assessment will sum up

<p>Year 2 Report on Professional Development By the time we began
preparing our Year 2 report on professional development, the number of
connected K-12 schools had jumped dramatically, from 35 percent to 78
percent. Today, that figure is nearing the 100 percent mark. We also
found the number of wired classrooms per school had increased
substantially, from 35 percent to 43 percent.</p>

<p>Only two states at the time of our report - North Carolina and
Vermont - required teaching candidates to have a portfolio that
demonstrated a use of technology. We also found that current spending on
professional development is inadequate. It is the CEO Forum's
recommendation that at least one-third of all technology spending be put
toward professional development. This is what we do in industry when we
take into account the Total Cost of Ownership of technology, and we
suggest that schools consider adopting this same practice.</p>

<p>It is clear from these findings that professional development
requires our attention if we are to continue the progress we've made in
bringing technology to our schools. K-12 schools are likely to hire two
million new teachers over the next decade to fill vacancies left by
retiring teachers and to accommodate class-size reduction efforts and
increasing student populations.</p>

<p>More than ever before, employers in all industries are demanding that
their employees have basic technology skills and skills enabled by the
use of technology. K-12 schools play a fundamental role in educating our
workforce and their importance will only increase as the economy becomes
more dependent on greater skills and education.</p>

<p>Only now are America's schools of education beginning to focus on
preparing their students - our future teachers - to understand and
embrace the power of technology-based teaching. The challenge is great:
many faculty at these institutions lack the skills and experience
necessary to turn technology into an effective learning tool for
themselves and for their students. Most faculty members do not stress or
demonstrate the effective use of information technology skills in
teaching</p>

<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA21.w.4.0.0"></span>
<p>The members of the CEO Forum believe professional development for
teachers is an ongoing, long-term, critical commitment that begins with
the decision to pursue a career in education and continues, through a
combination of formal and informal learning opportunities, for the
duration of a teaching career.</p>

<p>Teachers in our nation's K-12 schools work an average of 45 hours per
week with 33 of those spent at school. Of the remaining 12 hours,
teachers spend slightly more than three hours on activities involving
students and almost nine on other teaching-related activities.
Consequently, many dedicated teachers sacrifice their personal time to
learn about technology. These teachers are to be commended, but
self-directed training should supplement - not substitute for
appropriate and ongoing professional development.</p>

<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA22.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>the curriculum. National accreditation standards for schools of
education should be changed by the year 2000 to require those schools to
prepare new teachers and administrators to integrate technology into the
classroom. Schools of education should be encouraged to provide faculty
with the tools, incentives, and ongoing professional development they
need to integrate technology into the teacher-training curriculum by
2001. New teacher and administrator licensure and certification programs
should be implemented which require proficiency in integrating
technology into the curriculum by 2003. And technology funding should be
increased for schools of education.</p>

<p>I should mention here that the CEO Forum will soon publish a "Teacher

education assess their level of technology readiness in preparing
tomorrow's teachers. This self-assessment tool should be by complete by
December of this year.</p>

<p>The CEO Forum also commends the U.S. Department of Education's recent
award of $135 million in grants to train 400,000 new teachers in the use
of technology in education. The development of programs like the
Department's Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology (PTTT)
initiative is a clear indication that Congress is serious about
addressing this need.</p>

standards for effective continuing education on integrating technology
into the curriculum by 2000. Schools and districts should establish
long-term technology-related professional development plans and
proficiency standards for all teachers and administrators by 2000. Every
teacher and administrator should have ready access to appropriate
communications and information technology. Resources for
technology-related professional development should be increased. And
every professional development program should integrate technology as a
part of all training components.</p>

<p>the integration of technology into the curriculum. Hiring standards
for teachers and administrators should be adjusted to include technology
integration proficiency by fall 2000, and this proficiency should be
mandatory by 2002. Policy-makers and education administrators should
make a commitment by 2000 to prepare for technology-inclusive
professional development as a means of ensuring teacher and student
success in the classroom. Performance evaluations for in-service
teachers and school administrators should encourage and reward
technology integration and innovation by 2000. Subjectbased curriculum
standards and measurements should include appropriate technology
integration components by 2002. And student performance assessments
should capture the educational benefits enabled by technology by
2002.</p>

workplace skills. Corporations and local businesses should collaborate
with schools of education and K-12 schools to provide support and share
relevant best practices for integrating technology. The business
community should organize and sponsor technology leadership seminars for
principals and school administrators. We should provide leadership and
guidance on skills requirements that exist in the workplace. And we
should work with colleges of education, as we have done for years with
business schools, to devise, encourage and help fund an effective,
real-world curriculum that demonstrates the power of technologyenhanced
teaching.</p>

<p>We believe the bottom line is clear: to improve the way teachers
teach, the way students learn, and the way students and schools perform,
we need to improve technology-related professional development
throughout a teacher's career. The CEO Forum is committed to this work,
and we are very grateful for this Committee's commitment and leadership
in this field, as demonstrated by this important hearing today.</p>

<p>I would now like to recognize Dr. Glowa, but I wanted to also
acknowledge the fact that Mr. Smith from Texas is here with us. Mr.
Capuano from Massachusetts has also joined us.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Dr. Glowa, from my Congressional District.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. Thank you for this opportunity to address the Committee. I
am the Director of Instructional Technology for Montgomery County Public
Schools. Montgomery County has 189 schools with over 133,000 students.
We are currently the 11th fastest growing school district in the
Nation.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Five years ago, we began the Global Access Project, an initiative to
bring technology and on-line resources into every classroom and office.
Currently, 100 percent of our schools are networked to the Internet, and
about 80 percent of our classrooms. We are continuing this
initiative.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>The initiative was built on a tripod consisting of training and
support, hardware and software, and connectivity. As we have implemented
the project, we have been collecting data on the effectiveness of its
implementation. This data has provided us with feedback on what has
worked, what we need to modify, and the impact of technology on teaching
and learning.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Today, I am going to discuss the importance of staff development, in
supporting the successful integration of technology in schools. If
technology is to realize its powerful potential for improving education,
it must be used for more than just automating the traditional methods
and practices of teaching. That is the philosophy that we have adopted
as we have been integrating technology into the school system.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>For staff development to be effective, it must be ongoing, integrated
with the school district, and individual school strategic plans, and
instructional priorities, and offered collaboratively within a
curricular context. In addition, instructional staff, which includes
teachers, aids, librarians, and administrators, approach learning to use
technology with different skill and comfort levels.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Taking these factors into account and designing staff development
programs is essential. In an effective staff development program a
variety of approaches are used. In Montgomery County, we use at least 17
different approaches in our Staff Development Programs.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>They include coaching, modeling in the classroom, mentoring, student
experts, large and small workshops, sharing and collaboration, on-line
mentoring and collaboration, trainers of trainers, individualized
support, demonstration classrooms, multi-media interactive training,
on-line tutorials and courses, cable casting programs over our cable
stations, training in the field, sending people to attend conferences
and present at conferences, action research, teleconferencing, and
just-in-time support. Unless there is a comprehensive Staff Development
Program being able to change the teaching practices of teaching, of
teachers, becomes a monumental task.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA27.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>The knowledge and skills that instructional staff need to master
extend far beyond learning how to use software programs. Staff must
learn to use technology in an instructional context to support teaching
and learning. Not only do teachers need to learn to use<span

class="gtxt_body"> the equipment and software programs within the
contents of the instructional program, they also need to learn how to
incorporate a variety of teaching strategies, materials, and resources
into their program.</span></p>

class="gtxt_body">
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>They need to select appropriate teaching strategies and technologies
based upon student outcomes. They need to change the way they assess
student learning to include a wider range of assessment techniques,
including ways to evaluate the use of technology itself. Managing, and
scheduling, and instructional use of technology is also a new skill for
many teachers.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Administrators not only need to learn to use equipment and the
software relevant to their roles, but they also have to learn how to
develop and communicate a vision of how technology can support student
achievement and staff functioning.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>They need to incorporate technology into their local School
Improvement Plans. Unless technology is an integral part of a School
Improvement Plan, it is considered an add-on, and therefore is not given
the attention that it needs. Administrators need to model the use of
technology and the role of an active learner.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>They need to support staff in learning and using technology as a tool
for instruction, as well as for productivity. It is difficult for
individual schools to handle all of the aspects of staff development
needed to integrate technology into instructional practices.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>In the written testimony, I talked about some of the costs and
difficulties associated with the integration of technology in
classrooms. Primary to overcoming the barriers for schools, are issues
related to planning and implementation of staff development.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Schools can provide the instructional context, the just-in-time
support, the coaching, and the mentoring that are so essential. Schools
are also ideally situated for developing communities of learners.
However, based upon research studies and 5 years of experience with
supporting the implementation of a County-wide Global Access Initiative,
many, if not most, schools have significant problems in the following
eight areas:</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>1. Examining their school achievement data, and developing a School
Improvement Plan that incorporates the use of technology as an
instructional tool to support student achievement.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>2. Defining the skills that students need in developing a sequence of
activities to build these skills using technology as a tool, always
emphasizing that technology is the tool. It is not the means, it is not
the end, but a means to an end.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>3. Defining skills that teachers need to successfully integrate
technology into their instructional program based upon the School
Improvement Plan.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>4. Developing and implementing an appropriate long-range staff
development plan based on a staff needs assessment.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>5. Meeting the needs of adult learners who are scattered along a
continuum of novice to expert in their knowledge of different software
programs and their instructional applications.</p>
<span id="content-0011.xml#GBS.PA28.w.1.12.0"></span>
<p>Another area is having adequate lab facilities and staff who are
experts in technology, instructional strategies, curriculum, and staff
development. Having knowledge of and access to human, appropriate human
material, and network resources, and having suf<span

<p>Five years ago we began the Global Access Project, an initiative to
bring technology and on-line resources into every classroom and office.
This initiative was built on a tripod consisting of training and
support, hardware and software, and connectivity. As we have implemented
this project, we have been collecting data on the effectiveness of its
implementation and the impact of technology on teaching and learning.
Today I will discuss the importance of staff development in supporting
the successful integration of technology in schools.</p>

<p>For staff development to be effective, it must be continuous,
integrated with the school district and individual school strategic
plans and instructional priorities, and offered collaboratively within a
curricular context. In addition, instructional staff, teachers, aides,
librarians, and administrators, approach learning to use technology with
different skill and comfort levels. Taking these factors into account in
designing staff development programs is essential.</p>

<p>It is difficult for individual schools to handle all of the aspects
of staff training needed to integrate technology into instructional
practices. In the written response to the first question about the costs
and difficulties associated with successful integration of technology in
classrooms, a number of practices essential to overcoming barriers to
effective staff development were described. Primary to overcoming
barriers are those issues relating to support for planning and
implementation of staff development activities. Schools can provide the
instructional context, the just-in-time support, the coaching, and the
mentoring that are so essential to successful staff development
programs. Schools are ideally situated for developing community of
learners.</p>

<p>However, based upon research studies and five years of experience
with supporting the implementation of the countywide Global Access
initiative, many, if not most, schools have significant problems with
the following:</p>
<span id="content-0021.xml#GBS.PA31.w.8.1.0"></span>
<p>examining their student achievement data and developing a school

<p>1. What are the costs and difficulties associated with a successful
integration of technology in the classroom? Costs:</p>
<span id="content-0021.xml#GBS.PA37.w.3.1.0"></span>
<p>There are obvious and less obvious costs associated with the
successful integration of technology in the classroom. Although the
obvious costs are generally included in the funding of a school system's
implementation plan for instructional technology, the less obvious costs
sometimes are not included in the initial planning. School systems
struggle with funding these costs. Many times the obvious costs can be
funded with capital budget initiatives when the school system initially
builds the infrastructure, equips the schools, and provides baseline
staff training. The less obvious costs are ongoing costs and generally
must be funded from the school system's operating budget. Support from
grants and contributions from the private sector can also help defray
the costs.</p>

<p>One major non-budget cost also should be considered. Whenever a
teacher learns something new, it takes time to internalize what is
learned and to apply this learning effectively and seamlessly to the
instructional program. Teachers who are learning new technologies and
their application in the instructional program spend considerably more
time planning lessons than previously. Once the teachers have mastered
the new skills and knowledge to the point that they are a seamless part
of their thinking, the amount of time that must be devoted to planning
returns to a more normal level. This extra time that teachers spend
often goes unrecognized.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Network </span><span
style="font-style:italic;">design </span>- The network needs to be
designed with sufficient<br />
bandwidth to accommodate applications needed by staff and students and
to<br />
provide for future growth. Technical and instructional staff must work
in<br />
collaboration to design the local area networks (LANs) to be installed
in<br />
schools.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic;">Access </span><span

style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span
style="font-style:italic;">school </span><span
style="font-style:italic;">day </span>- When a school chooses to<br />
devote the majority of computers and technology peripherals to
computer<br />
labs, this decision severely limits student daily access to computer
technology.<br />
It directly limits the access points (networked computers) available
in<br />
classrooms.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0021.xml#GBS.PA38.w.2.2.0"></span>
<p>Each classroom needs a minimum of one networked computer and a<br />
projection device available daily for maximum student use. Teachers
in<br />
the Montgomery County Public School system rated this lack of access
as<br />
the number one barrier to using technology.<br />
School practices regarding the scheduling of labs and the media center
and<br />
sharing the resources to support instructional priorities also
influence<br />
teacher and student access.<br />
Schools need sufficient equipment to place computers in the labs,
library<br />
media center, and classrooms. Sufficient copies or networked versions
of<br />
software need to be available to support student use in multiple
locations.<br />
In addition, departments need to share their resources based on the
whole<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0021.xml#GBS.PA38.w.2.3.0"></span>
<p>school's instructional needs, not just departmental needs.<br />

to the Internet, to<br />

school<br />
day is an issue that needs to be addressed and overcome by school
systems.<br />
• Although much has been written about the digital divide, not much
has<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0021.xml#GBS.PA38.w.2.4.0"></span>
<p>been written about the widespread lack of home access to the software

environment?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA40.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>Collaboration of the private sector, higher education institutions,
government agencies, and a public school system has been successfully
modeled in Montgomery County, Maryland. This partnership has been based
upon mutual recognition that each member brings something useful to the
partnership, and that the partnership builds upon and extends the
expertise of each institution. The Geographic Information System (GIS)
and Smithsonian National Air and Space Partnerships are examples of
this. The GIS involves Towson University, Montgomery County Park and
Planning Commission, and Montgomery County Public Schools in a
collaborative effort to facilitate the student use of GIS files to
analyze authentic data. The Smithsonian National Air and Space
Partnership involves the Smithsonian, NASA, and MCPS in developing
lesson plans using resources from NASA and staff training provided by
the Smithsonian.</p>

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA40.w.3.0.0"></span>
<p>One key consideration by any organization partnering with a pre-K-12
institution is that schools and teachers are under intense pressure to
improve student performance. Anything that impacts the classroom and
instruction that is not based on improving student performance within
the curricular context is viewed as an add-on and is not likely to be
adopted or, if adopted, is not likely to be sustained.</p>

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA40.w.4.1.0"></span>
<p>Decisions regarding what equipment is needed to support a school
system's wide area network (WAN) should be influenced by both the
instructional and productivity<span
style="font-style:italic;">/</span>business requirements that the WAN
will need to support. An interdisciplinary unit, comprised of
instructional staff and technology experts charged with obtaining these
requirements from the persons responsible for implementing these
functions, needs to work collaboratively to make hardware, software,
instructional and network design decisions.</p>

minimum configuration of one networked, multi-media computer and one
projection device per classroom should be part of a school's
standard</p>

<p>configuration. Schools then should decide what additional equipment

<p>4. What is the most appropriate role of the federal government in
education technology?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA41.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>The federal government support for schools in the form of the
Regional EdTech laboratories, grants, school improvement and topical
conferences, encouragement of private sector support and involvement,
and financing for and publication of research has been helpful.
Increased communication about these efforts and supports would assist

issues for staff and students, particularly in high poverty areas, and
grants to support the staff development needs of schools continue to be
a priority need.</p>

<p>It is difficult for individual schools to handle all of the aspects
of staff training needed to integrate technology into instructional
practices. In responding to the first question about the costs and
difficulties associated with successful integration of technology in
classrooms, a number of practices essential to overcoming barriers to
effective staff development were described. Primary to overcoming
barriers are those issues relating to support for planning and
implementation of staff development activities. Schools can provide the
instructional context, the just-in-time support, the coaching, and the
mentoring that are so essential to successful staff development
programs. Schools are ideally situated for developing community of
learners.</p>

<p>The existence of a dedicated instructional technology support unit
would greatly assist schools in planning and implementing staff
development activities. This unit would need to be composed of staff
members who are experts in schoolbased technology hardware tools and
software, instructional strategies, curriculum, and staff development.
Since curriculum and instructional strategies vary greatly along the
pre-K-12 continuum and are dependent upon the developmental stages of
the learners as well as the content demands, there need to be
instructional specialists who are experts in not only these
developmental stages, but also the content areas.</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Very extensive and well-organized. Delighted you
are here, Dr. Glowa<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>We are now
very pleased to hear from Dr. Fallon.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. Thank you, Madam Chair. Members of the Committee, the
East Hartford School District is an urban, suburban district with a
variety of educational settings; nine elementary schools, one middle
school, one high school, two magnet schools, one alternative high
school, one transitional school, grades k-12, for high risk special
education students, and an early childhood head start school.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>The student population is 7,958 students. Our minority<span
style="font-style:italic;">/</span>majority enrollment is 59.3 percent,
and 31.3 percent of all students receive free and reduced priced meals.
Students with a non-English home language comprise 15.7 percent of our
student body. Four hundred twenty computers are located in classroom
settings in the elementary schools.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Seventy computers in laboratory settings at the middle school, and
175 computers in laboratory settings in the high school and alternative
school, with some exceptions. Fifty PCs donated by local corporations,
computers are purchased or leased new. Staff development for technology
has emphasized the infusion of technology into the curriculum.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Basic application training, Microsoft Office, aims at giving teachers
the ability to use technology in their daily instruction, and to enable
students to use technology as a learning tool. All our schools have
access to the Internet. Four work stations in every elementary
classroom, grades 3 to 6, and multi-lab access in the middle and high
schools. This level of Internet connection has been possible only
through a State of Connecticut Infrastructure Grant, not obtained by
many school districts, and a special State of Connecticut Economic
Development Grant.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Students use the technology for basic research, both CD-ROM and the
Internet, for writing exercises, for the creation of presentations, and
we are beginning to look at the development of higher level thinking
skills. Our district-wide strategic plan contains strategies for the
further implementation of information technology into the
curriculum.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>We have six strategies within our Strategic Plan. Two of those
strategies deal with technology. Five years ago, we did not have one
strategy that dealt with technology. Funding remains a crucial problem,
both for support staff and for technology purchase.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Our approach, up to this point, has been to install the most robust
infrastructure we can afford, with the idea of it being able to handle
future technology developments. Numerous workshops, funded through our
own professional development monies and through outside professional
development grants, have continued to be designed to help teachers
integrate their teaching with the available technology.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA43.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>We have limited training in system maintenance to six individuals. As
wide area networks and their operating systems have become more complex,
we cannot rely upon classroom teachers to keep the hardware optional or
operational. Major wiring and network configuration is contracted
through outside services. The only<span

<p>Our purchasing investment decisions are shaped by such factors as
ease of use, the kind of system support provided, and the type of grants
available. Funding serves as a keystone to all decisions. Two computer
laboratories we are presently bringing on-line in the middle and the
high school are being setup by commercial vendors that place advertising
on their browsers and collect student data.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>We have been forced to work with this type of vendor because of our
concern for providing our student population with equal access to
information technology. Another key component of this decision is the
provisions these firms provide for maintenance and repair.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Overhead costs are the bottom 23 of the iceberg in implementing
computer technology in the schools. The Internet access we provide our
students is crucial to their remaining competitive, both in the
marketplace and in furthering their education. Most of our families do
not have Internet access in their homes. Even telephone service can be
very sporadic.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Not to provide these students with training in the use of information
technology will lead to a further widening of the racial, social, and
economic divide that threatens the very essence or existence of our
democracy. By earmarking federal monies to focus specifically on the
provision of information tech in all schools, Congress is addressing a
major fault line in American society.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>New technologies that facilitate the sharing of teaching units, and
expertise among teachers in school districts over the worldwide Web,
promise a much more effective use of resources, than has been possible
by isolated individual teachers acting alone. These new teaching tools
are expensive, though more cost effective than present distant learning
technologies.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA44.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>The development of a critical mass of teaching expertise and
experience in the use of information technology in the classroom will
provide a reliable continuing source of funding and other kinds of
federal support. Laws requiring a greater classroom presence of public
utilities, such as cable companies, for example, could further leverage
whatever monies the Federal Government cannot furnish. Progress of this
nature will not be possible without effective federal legislation. Thank
you.</p>

nature will not be possible without effective federal legislation.</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Dr. Fallon.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>You have all been terrific in your presentations. I am now going to
recognize for the first round of questioning Chairman Smith.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Well, let me start out with maybe what I consider tough
questions. When should a school upgrade its computers? Do not give me if
you are going to use the word “obsolete” or something, define it.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. Our plan is that we now have pretty much somewhat in
place what we wish to have, at least for the present. In terms of
updating, there is no way that we can do it on a yearly basis, in terms
of taking care of the changes that we have that are occurring. So, our
plan very simply is this.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Every year, we allot 20 percent of the budget that goes toward
technology, so we are looking at over 5 years changing our entire system
and updating. And that is our plan. So, for example, we have figured
roughly</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. That is sort of the answer I wanted.<br />
Dr. FALLON. Okay.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. You are saying roughly every 5 years. Some businesses and
companies suggest that when they can improve their efficiency 25
percent, then they upgrade. Some companies decide when they can improve
their efficiency 40 percent to try to keep down their cost. And so, I am
just wondering in terms of the utilization within schools. Anybody else
have any reaction to that?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. Mr. Smith, I would just mention that having just sent a
son off to college, who is badgering me for a very expensive computer,
he makes the argument that if I can buy him the top of the line now, he
thinks it will last him for 4 years. And my addition to</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. It will not.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. Well, probably not. He will change his mind 2 years from
now. But one rule of thumb is try to use a computer at least until the
software you want to use will not run on it anymore. Advances in
software often dictate when you cannot use an old piece of hardware.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Well, I mean, that is certainly true. So, you use your old
hardware. I mean, it is easy to, if you are going to make your decisions
based simply on the new more efficient software, then my guess is you
are going to be changing every 2 years or every 2.5 years.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>A question that is sort of maybe on the periphery of the discussion
of technology education, Mr. Spoon, do you think there is merit in
students learning how to read technical journals? I will not even talk
about writing technical journals, but reading a technical journal. Would
you consider this part of technology skills?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.12.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. No.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.13.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. And so, is there a broader question. Is it, would you
think it is an appropriate part of our K-12 education to move in the
direction of helping students be able to read and write technical
journals?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.14.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. No. I—you have heard a phrase used in Dr. Glowa's remarks,
“tools.” This is what the computers and the network</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA52.w.1.15.0"></span>
<p>can be. They can be seamless invisible tools for a higher purpose.
That does not suggest that some people will have a great appetite for

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>There is precious little time in the course of a K-12 education to be
turning to trade school kinds of applications in skill development when
these tools are available for learning reading, writing, mathematics,
history, critical thinking.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Yes. I am just a little nervous about if you go to your
local auto mechanic and look at the journal that they are reading, and
that they are trying to consume and evaluate, many of them right out of
high school, then it seems to me that we have got to be very careful in
the goals that we are trying to achieve as we develop theseas we utilize
the additional technical tools that are available to us.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>And how much traditionally, it seems to me, there has been a great
push on the part of parents to say, do what you need to do so my kid can
go to the next level up and graduate from a university. And I am just
not sure. Mr. Fallon, what is you reaction?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. My reaction is the same in terms of technical journals.
That is something that we specialize in probably in the junior year of
high school, with a certain small segment of the population that is
interested in pursuing something like that. But that really is not our
goal.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Yes. I am going to query that later in terms of just the
need for more of our students, even in the university level, to be able
to understand some of these technical manuals. It seems reasonable. Yes,
Ms. Glowa.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. One of the things that we are really emphasizing with
students is reading for information and being able to read in a variety
of contexts. And being able to read whether you call them technical
manuals, or being able to read scientific reports is a skill that is
stressed across many content areas. There are also computer sciences
classes that are very specifically designed for students who want to
pursue the computer science area.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>They are some of our most popular high school elective classes, and
in fact are coming down into the middle school area, by popular demand.
So, teaching it as an isolated skill, in terms of reading technical
manuals, I am not</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Yes. It is not an isolated skill.<br />
Dr. GLOWA. Right.<br />
Dr. SMITH. It takes a great deal of broad education.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Ms. GLOWA. But teaching it as one of the areas where what we are
trying to do is teach students how to read a variety of information and
be able to understand it and analyze it is essential.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Let me finish up, Madam Chairman, if I might. Would the
millions of dollars government spends in this area, have any studies
been published in terms of the educational effectiveness of technology
in the classroom? Either now or later, if you could furnish this.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA53.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. The U.S. Department of Education had a conference this
July that was taking a look at the research that has been published
recently on the effectiveness of technology. One of the major studies
that just came out, and you may know the authors. I have it memorized as
one that was done in West Virginia, where West Virginia did a Statewide
initiative and showed concrete results, in<span

<p>Another one was another Statewide initiative. And I believe it was
Idaho. And they have some very concrete information on that. <span
style="font-style:italic;">We </span>have been looking at it for 5 years
and have local school system data. That at this point, the U.S. State

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Madam Chairman.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Did you want to add to that, briefly, Mr.
Spoon<span style="font-style:italic;">? </span>Mr. SPOON. I wanted to
add to that. Chairwoman MORELLA. I think he wanted to add.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. Only briefly because it comes from experience outside the
classroom. It comes from experience outside the classroom. Please
understand that my life experience, other than being an expert parent,
perhaps in trying to help my child's education, really is in the
business sphere. So, we have to be careful about attributing expertise
that our Forum has in the report to my personal experience in teaching.
I have not taught in classrooms.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Anyway, we have an education business at the Washington Business at
the Washington Post Company called Kaplan Education Centers. And we
teach thousands of students every year, over 100,000 students, both in
the college, graduate school, and the K8 level. And we use extensively
technology support customization software, networks.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>It is clear to us and it is clear to our clientele that it is highly
efficient and highly leveraged learning for their purposes, be it
advanced chemistry for medical school entry, or preparing for the SAT,
or the law boards, or understanding what is required to be competent in
the third grade, 6 month of reading. So, my personal experience in the
business sphere is one that supports the notion that leveraged learning
from computers is well-established.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you.<br />
I want to recognize now Congresswoman Johnson.<br />
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>I am sitting here thinking that for my State of Texas, we have many
jobs, and do not have the people with the proper background and
education to fill them. And could very well lose some of those jobs
because of it. My concern is not so much whether the students will
learn, if they have access to the technology.</p>

<p>My concern is whether or not there should be some new standards set
for, in higher education curricula to assist teachers and integrating
technology into all of the courses. We find not only very large shortage
of teachers, but also a large number of teachers that do not have these
skills. And I do not even know where we go to begin to fill this
gap.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Could you comment on that?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA54.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. Ms. Johnson, a recent publication of the National
Research Council, I think, may help us pursue this important matter. It
is called Fluency in Information Technology or “fitness” to use their
terminology. It proposes—it is a current look at what appears to be the
most important things to learn at the undergraduate level in information
technology to assist young students obtain the right skills.</p>

<p>We hope to work with them and see if we can pursue these matters in
the coming time to help spread the word on just how we enlighten our
curriculums at the undergraduate level.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. I have seen it in schools anecdotally, and more
systematically in business. That the power of identifying early
champions and creating clearinghouses for best practices through kind of
an intense inspirational circle where people understand the benefit of
what somebody else has discovered, and follow it, and improve on it.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>And efforts to create clearing houses, inspired clearinghouses, and
the sharing of best practices are consistent with comments you have
heard here would be a way to go. But one of the things our report cited
was the lack of time that teachers have. It is a very full-time job, in
excess of 40 hours. Much of it, not most of it, but a large part of it
spent at home dealing with classroom matters.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>And then on top of that, we are expecting teachers to go out on their
own initiative, and time, and perhaps expense to complete that cycle.
There are funding issues. And there are resource allocation issues, in
so far as teacher time that have to be faced. Otherwise, you know, it is
just added to the stack of high priorities.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. In terms of whether or not higher educational institutions
should have technology as a core component to Teacher Preparation
Programs, we are working in a collaborative partnership with the
University of Maryland, Hopkins, Towson, and also Montgomery County
Community College.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Each one of those universities is looking at their current Teacher
Preparation Programs and how they are integrating technology into that.
Many of them have classes similar to the classes I took when I was
taking my teacher preparation stuff where you go and learn how to use
the computer, or learn how to use an application.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>What they are moving towards is, as you are actually teaching the
science content classes and the math content classes, integrating the
technology in those classes as they are being taught so that people
learn how to use the technology within the content area. That will have
the most impact on teachers knowing how to use technology to teach.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. The same situation is now occurring at the University of
Connecticut. That just started 2 years ago, in terms of their teacher
preparation courses are concerned. That they now are mandating that
certain technology courses are a part of the curriculum. So, as these
students come out into the workforce, they are somewhat computer
literate.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>That is somewhat unusual, I might add, in terms of Connecticut. The
other universities in Connecticut do not have that component, which is
quite interesting. The other thing that has just occurred in
Connecticut, as of July 1, every 5 years we undergo renewal of our
certification.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA55.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>And we have to complete a total of 18 Continuing Education Units per
year or a total of 90 over 5 years. If you do not complete those, then
certainly you will not be renewed for certification. The State of
Connecticut has just mandated that 15 hours for all teachers required,
in terms of technology courses that have to be taken. That is for our
teaching staff that presently exist.</p>

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.0.0"></span>
<p>That really gives us the clout that we need, in terms of staff
development, in the direction that we are going. So, that is very
productive for us.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Actually, piggy-backing on the questions that have been asked, we all
know that technology alone is not going to improve the performance in
schools. That the key really are the teachers. And the CEO Forum on
Education and Technology has made a number of recommendations in this
area.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>One calls for changing national accreditation standards for schools
of education, to require that those schools prepare new teachers and
administrators to integrate technology in the classroom. The CEO Forum
also recommends implementing new Teacher and Administrator Licensor and
Certificate Programs to require proficiency in integrating technology in
the curriculum. I wonder, Mr. Spoon, what kind of reaction have you been
receiving from administrators and teachers to those recommendations? Are
they supportive<span style="font-style:italic;">? </span></p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. They have been very supportive. It has been encouraging. I
think there is, as well, a swell of self-assessed pressure to move up to
the front of the class, as far as joining the leaders in matching that
standard. But up against that is the absence of resources. And the lack
of a systematic kind of accountability. It is easy to talk about effort,
but it is more difficult to talk about achievement.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>You know, setting feasible goals and being measured thereby. Things
have moved positively over the past several years. I recall when my
daughter's school was looking for an education technologist, how few
schools of education actually had programs where qualified candidates
could be found. That is growing.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>But if I recall the data correctly within our report, roughly 13 of
teachers of teaching, graduates of teaching colleges, are coming out of
institutions that, you know, having yet signed onto national voluntary
accreditation standards for adequacy and competency in technology
training. It is disturbing.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>That number might be 25 percent now, but that is hundreds of
thousands of teachers over time. I, last week, overhear a conversation
between a parent and a very able young woman who is in college choosing
majors. And she had elected to go on to designate teaching.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>The conversation turned, I was not a part of it, to are you going to
take any courses in computer technology and skills? And she said, no. I
am choosing teaching because I do not have to take those kinds of
courses.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Yes. That is the kind of attitude that can occur.
I mean, English majors think they do not need to use the Internet. Yet,
I have seen some of the best teaching of poetry done with technology in
the classrooms. Of course, I grew up and I pose this would happen with
many of your teachers that you currently have, not so much the new ones
when “log-on” meant throwing a log on the fire. And a “curser" did not
use the right language.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA56.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>And it was only 8 years ago when that there were like 50 sites on the
Internet. Now, there are like 100,000 per day, people who,</p>

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>I did not know whether the rest of you wanted to comment on that at
all. Yes, Dr. Fallon.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. This year in East Hartford, and I am quite sure you have
already done this, but in East Hartford by November 1st, every certified
staff member must register on their computer, or on the computers that
we have, data in terms of their background. And in addition to that,
take an assessment in terms of technology.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>And what we will be doing, and this, now, the reason we are able to
do this is because we have the help of United Technologies Corporation.
And they have assisted us, East Hartford. That is why we are where we
are today. And so what is going to be happening is that we then will
categorize every certified staff member in terms of technology</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>There will be three levels. After that, we then, with the cooperation
of United Technologies, have setup a number of courses that our staff
will take. So, based on your level, basic meaning you just started off,
there will be certain courses that you will take. And we can monitor
everything. That also will be a part of the CEU package that I alluded
to before.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>So, within 3 to 4 years, we are going to have an entire staff that
will be, I think, at least right in the middle in terms of technology.
The other thing that I say to our staff is there is no choice anymore.
There is no choice. I mean, it is here. It is something that we deal
with on a daily basis. And it is our responsibility to take these
courses and to be computer literate. And that is the direction that we
are going.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. You are pretty unique. Is Connecticut pretty
unique in the Country for doing that?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. With all due respect, and I hope not too many people back
home are watching this, no. No, Connecticut is not, and that is a major
concern in terms of the government, in terms of Connecticut, et cetera.
Ironically, we are not one of the leaders in terms of technology. But
there are initiatives being established.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>And certainly Congressman Larson has been involved historically in
Connecticut to begin moving in that particular direction. But
ironically, we are not one of the leaders in terms of technology.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. You mentioned United Technologies. Dr. Glowa, you
know, we have the 1-270 corridor. I also know that, I see from the
papers you have submitted that you have received some grants, the school
system has, to do some collaborative work with some of the business
community. And I know looking at the CEO members, you have got a lot of
heavy hitters on that list too.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>And I know that the National Science Foundation would be aware of
this too. Are you working, are you getting cooperation from these
corporations on the 1-270 corridor? Do we need to do something more with
getting them involved? How is it working out?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA57.w.1.11.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. There are advantages and disadvantages to being a. very
large school district. One of the disadvantages is working with some of
the industries because the fear of showing favoritism toward certain
schools. So, we do not get as much of their support</p>

not as much as we would like to get.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Why could you not assign them<span
style="font-style:italic;">? </span><span style="font-style:italic;">I
</span>mean, you know, work something out like that. Do you want to
comment on that, Mr. Spoon about, I am sure the CEO Forum has looked
into what more can be done for partnerships?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. With all of the resources our membership in similarly
situated companies have, that by itself does not cover the extent of the
problem. It does not fully address the digital divide issues. We all, I
believe, are trying to put our hearts in the right place, and the
significant portions of our community budgets in the right place. It
does not reach the full extent of it. So, yes, we have another division
of our Company that is a cable company.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Every school we go by, we drop a cable line in there, not just for
video, but it will be for high speed Internet. And the cable industry is
working on that, as our other conduits. I am sure the phone companies
have similar offerings to make. The issue though is not hardware and
connectivity in our view alone.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>The metaphor that I used in talking about this report about 6 months
ago was, increasingly we have put the food stuffs, and the condiments,
and the pots and pans on the shelves, in the refrigerator, and in the
kitchen. Now, it is time to teach ourselves how to become cooks of
savory meals.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>The ingredients are being assembled. And it comes back to the
teachers, their competence, their adoption, their enthusiasm, and their
excitement. And as I develop the case for our systematic overarching
kind of role where, again, I defer to you clearly on what the federal
role can be.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Facilitating, stimulating, extensive awareness of where the cutting
edge is, creating in a positive way professional peer pressure so that
the school system in some other corner of Connecticut looks longingly at
what Mr. Fallon is doing and saying, what about us? And the parents in
that school district are aware of where the State ranks in a technology
readiness self-assessment like the STAR chart represented, you know.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>The data behind that represents 80,000 schools filling out
questionnaires and updating the data base. That data is nullable and
schools are categorizable. And, yes<span style="font-style:italic;">,
</span>we all have concerns about issuing lists and being rank ordered.
But when it comes to our kids, let nothing stand in the way<span
style="font-style:italic;">. </span></p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Urging awareness of standing of teachers in their preparation, what
percent of our in-service faculty has been through professional
development in connection with technology integration in the last 3
years<span style="font-style:italic;">? </span>I will ask that question
at the next school board meeting, you know<span
style="font-style:italic;">. </span></p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA58.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>It would be interesting to know if that became a standardized kind of
reporting fact, how school districts stood. And, you know, one could ask
what fraction of teachers coming in for licensor in the 25 states that
do not require computer education have determined that, you know, x or y
percent of those matriculating, not matriculating, but those enrolling
teachers have those skills, or should it just be a requirement? So,
there is a horty-tory role for you to play here, in addition to a
funding role.</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. Actually, we are moving in that direction. And I
think with our reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary School
Act, this is good opportunity we have to do some of those things. My
time has elapsed for the first round. I did not know Mr. Strawn, I did
not mean to eliminate, leave you out if you okay, well, we will get to
you the next time.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>And now I am pleased to recognize Mr. Larson.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. LARSON. Thank you again, Madam Chairwoman. I thank the panelists
for their very informative remarks. Let me first, by way of comment, my
wife is always quick to remind me that with respect to legislation and
with respect to technology, no piece of legislation or technology ever
tucks a child in at night, or reads to them, or gives them the kind of
nurturing. That there is just simply no substitute for a caring
adult.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Let me also add, by way of comment, especially in lieu of the
legislation that has been submitted by both, Ms. Morella, Ms. Stabenow,
and myself, along the lines of teacher training. That I concur
wholeheartedly with Mr. Spoon about the importance of teaching</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Again, referring back to that Department of Commerce report and
hearing that was held. There is a need for 350,000 people currently to
be employed in the high technology system. I believe it is the business
community that ultimately is going to drive this issue.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>And in as much as there is going to be a need for some 2 million more
teachers over the next 10 years, the component parts that <span
style="font-style:italic;">Ms. </span>Morella and others have discussed
with respect to our university systems turning out competent, qualified
teachers is extraordinarily important. The efforts that the East
Hartford School System, in conjunction with United Technologies,
demonstrate what partnership, how partnerships can work when the private
sector works hand-in-glove, so to speak, with the academic sector in
helping to assist and develop that teacher training component.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>I have submitted legislation that looks at providing tax credits for
teachers who purchase lap top computers and other technology. And I know
other members have focused on this concept, as well as the tuition tax
credits, to go back and get the kind of education that you need.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>And also looking at corporate America, in terms of not wanting to
thwart any efforts that are currently going on altruistically in terms
of donating time, and hours, and buddying up with school systems, but
also providing a tax incentive there for businesses to seek and make
sure that they are assisting creating that workforce of the 21st Century
that we so vitally need.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>But I come to, though I concur with Mr. Spoon about the importance of
having that hands-on, there can be no high tech without the high touch
of a professionally trained teacher within the context of a classroom.
There can be no furtherance of education if we do not use, as you point
out, tools to be more diagnostic in our approach, to be more
prescriptive with our remedies, and ultimately to be in a position that
technology will provide us, as Ms. Morella often says, to be able to
individualize instruction.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA59.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Now, you are Dr. Fallon or you are Dr. Glowa. And you are in a school
system. And you are talking about what is the best means<span
id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.0.0"></span><span
id="content-0030.xml#para.63.1.0.box.297.318.1763.227.q.101"

right for Hebron, or what is right for Connecticut may not be right for
California<span style="font-style:italic;">? </span></span></p>

<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>Is it broad-band width? Is it radio wave? Is it infrared? Is it
satellite connections? The question that I am seeking to have our
experts and the people at NSF grapple with and answer in the business
community is, how do we in a most cost effective means provide our
superintendents of schools, our school systems, with the infrastructure
that they are going to need to carry this out?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>And my concern here is two-fold. One, I think that we are being
leap-frogged with our own technology by other nations. That is number
one. And number two, a point that Dr. Fallon makes about maintenance.
How can any superintendent of schools plan today initiating no matter
how robust, as Dr. Fallon points out, a system that could be obsolete
under Morris Law in 6 to 12 months?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>And with, if you will follow Morris Law to conclusion, and at the
rate of which technology is changing, without federal intervention,
without the collective academic, business, and governmental sectors
coming together, I do not see how school systems continue to make these
kinds of decisions without bankrupting themselves locally, or getting
turned away when they go to bonding referendums.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>What would be your thoughts on that? I will start with Dr. Strawn and
work down.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Dr. STRAWN. Well, I agree with what you have said. And the need to
understand the technology, to find out what is the most effective and
efficient way to utilize means of bringing the technology into the
classroom is extremely important, since it involves major amounts of
dollars and cents. I might parenthetically add, I have to disagree with
what Mr. Spoon said about teachers not having time.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>My observation is most public school teachers have at least 6 hours a
day that they can learn this stuff, between midnight and 6:00 a.m. <span
style="font-style:italic;">I </span>would also mention that we are doing
what we can at the NSF to help obsolete any studies that we might make
about the efficiencies of information technology right now by seeing
what we can do to make it 100 times faster, 100 times cheaper, and 100
times easier to use.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>In so far as the researchers we support are successful in those three
important dimensions. We will simply put more emphasis on those 6 hours
that public school teachers have between midnight and 6:00 a.m. to learn
even more available and effective technologies.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. You ask a very difficult and important question. What do
you attack first<span style="font-style:italic;">?
</span>Infrastructure, training, and if you apply the shrinking cycle
time of new chapters of technology, with the more constant cycle time of
people coming up to speed in learning new talents and skills. We could
be through three generations of technology before we are a generation of
teachers comfortable in using what has since passed.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA60.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>I think our view is getting faculty, addressing just instructional
faculty for the moment, not maintenance because that is a significant
issue as well, comfortable with the possibilities, and the di<span

possibilities of technology will make them better able to cope with
future cycle changes.</span></p>

class="gtxt_body">
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>You have to cut into that circle sooner than later. Better to skip a
cycle of technology and to have more adoption and utilization of
existing platforms that are very powerful and under-utilized, than to
get invested in the hardware and the infrastructure without having
addressed making faculty comfortable in knowing how to drive the latest
car with the latest dashboard.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Because the fact is when you buy that latest car, you are able to
figure out eventually how to use the dashboard because you have seen one
of those before. But if you do not have any idea which is the front of
the car and what the steering wheel is, it is intimidating, whether it
is an old technology model or a new one.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>So, the advocacy here is let us accelerate adoption and comfort at
all levels of the system, going back to the teachers' colleges, going
back to licensor on entry, going back to commitments on professional
training ongoing, and giving support for best practices and clearing
houses so that the champions, you know, can make not a 3-year adoption
phase to 50 percent of the faculty, but can do it in the course of 18
months. There are even examples in our report of where, there are two
examples that are worth noting.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>One is a system in the Midwest that is using the kids to teach the
teachers because they are ahead of the line and recognizing the kids as
a resource. The other is a pyramid scheme. We know we do not like those
phrases, but the program is called Tag Team Approach, where every
teacher has an obligation to find yet another one, and pass along what
they just learned from the last one, and what they could add to it.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>It is a way of mushrooming. I am not answering the difficult question
that you raised about getting up to speed to support all of this, but I
think cutting into the hardware and technology cycle is an appropriate
way to get established to handle the change that lies ahead.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>We will
have another round, Mr. Larson. I wanted to recognize the fact that Mr.
Wu is here from Oregon, and on this side of the aisle, Mr. Ehlers.
Incidently, today is World Standards Day. I also wanted to, people get
hazy when they think of standards, but they are critically important.
And this Subcommittee has dealt with it a great deal. But I also wanted
to point out that Mr. Ehlers this morning is recognized by the Science
Coalition for his work in science.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Mr. EHLERS. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>I also have to comment that it is perfectly appropriate for you to
Chair this Committee on Standards Day, since you set a very high
standard for all of us. So, we will try to follow that. I am hesitant to
ask any questions because I was at other meetings and I missed the
testimony.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA61.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>But being a Title X-professor, I cannot resist making a few comments.
Just based on what I have heard during the short time here, it fits into
the format of what I think is the problem. And that is finding,
training, and keeping good teachers. And a very important part of that
is not just recruiting new ones, and training,<span

<p>and keeping them, but also good professional development
programs.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>And that is one reason I have been fighting very hard and I have been
joined at that by Mr. Wu in the Education Committee, fighting hard to
keep the Eisenhower Professional Development Program and keep it going.
I would also very much like to see in the future, NSF expanding</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.2.0"></span>
<p>the summer institutes, which it has had for many years.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.3.0"></span>
<p>And which, if I am not mistaken, have been reduced from the hey day
of the 1970s. And I think that is a very effective means of keeping the
teachers current with respect to using technology in the classroom. So,
I hope my personal feeling, as apparent from that, the emphasis has to
be on the teacher.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.4.0"></span>
<p>Mr. Larson has observed the importance of the teacher, and the care
of the child, and the interaction of the child. But also, we have to
recognize our responsibility. And states have to recognize their
responsibility. And especially local school systems have to recognize
their responsibility to their teachers in terms of professional
training, professional development to keep up with the field.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.5.0"></span>
<p>Just to give a parallel, we deal every summer with this, or every
year, with this problem of extending or expanding H1B Visas for, so that
we can bring in engineers and technical people from other countries. At
the same time, we have a substantial engineer work for us which is
unemployed or under-employed, mostly above the</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.6.0"></span>
<p>Is it impossible for us to train those teachers to handle the modern
day workplace? Is it impossible for them to learn that? I do not know
the answer, but I suspect that it might be more beneficial if we have
programs to get them trained, rather than just expanding the number of
H1B Visas. And the same thing with teachers.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.7.0"></span>
<p>We tend to give up too readily, I think, on teachers who simply say,
oh, I cannot do that, when in fact what they need is 4 week's to be
shown that not only can they do it, but they can do it far better than
they or anyone else thought. So, I hope we keep that in mind. If anyone
wants to respond briefly, that is fine, but I am just delivering my
usual sermon. Any comments?</p>

Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chairwoman.<br />

<p>It appears to me that our challenges are great and deep when it comes
to bringing technology to the classroom. I mean, not only modern
equipment, modern software, we are talking about equipment and software
that, like a piece of fruit, rots. And as soon as we get it, it is
getting old.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA62.w.2.14.0"></span>
<p>But I see our challenge also is teaching our staff so that they can
use the technology to teach, our administrators so they can use</p>

<p>technology to manage, our students so they can use technology to
learn to create, to research, and also to communicate.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.1.0"></span>
<p>But there is something that we have not been talking about. And that
is, and I will get to my question. And my question is should we not be
bringing technology to the classroom so that our students can
troubleshoot and repair the systems? They can build printed circuit
boards, even simple ones. Possibly, they can design software<span
style="font-style:italic;">/</span>hardware programs so that when they
leave high school, get ready for college, or to go into the workforce,
they actually understand technology from many different angles.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Just a few years ago, there was a survey on the jobs that paid a good
liveable wage that were not being filled in this Country, that were not
college jobs. One of them is a mechanic. Open the hood of a car, you
have to know electronics in order to be a mechanic these days.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>So, will you talk to the possibility of expanding beyond using
technology in order, you know, versus understanding technology<span
style="font-style:italic;">? </span>Let us start down here with Dr.
Fallon.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. One of the comments I would make immediately is we have
an alternative high school, which is Synergy. It is grade 9 through 12,
for those students who have difficulty in a large high school. Three of
those students, when they graduated last year, they now have their own
technology company.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Ms. WOOLSEY. There you go.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Mr. FALLON. And they, I might add, not that I make a tremendous
amount of money, but each of them at the age of 19 is making
considerably more money than I will ever think of making. They were very
involved at Synergy, in terms of the maintenance of the equipment, et
cetera.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Believe it or not, they learned all of that from a custodian that we
have at Synergy who is a technology wiz. And so things like that are
happening. There are a couple of other districts that have a number of
students, and they teach them around the freshman and sophomore years.
And they serve in terms of the maintenance.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>The problem we have in East Hartford is there is a point at which we
have probably five or six people that can deal with the maintenance. But
when we start getting more sophisticated, that is where we are
fortunate. We bring the people from, I keep mentioning UTC, but they
have been fabulous. We bring their experts in, and they pretty much
recommend things to us.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>So, that is the advantage you have with the corporations and their
involvement. I might also point out very quickly, we are very involved
with the corporate world because we have the School-Business
Partnership. And we have everyone that has anything to do with East
Hartford involved with us. That is a tremendous assistance for our
district.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Ms. WOOLSEY. Create partnership.<br />
Dr. FALLON. I just wanted to say that. Thank you.<br />
Ms. WOOLSEY. Absolutely.<br />
Ms. JOHNSON. Would the gentle lady yield for just one moment.<br />
Ms. WOOLSEY. Sure.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA63.w.1.11.0"></span>

<p>Ms. JOHNSON. Well, you mentioned that they are making more than you.
And I think when teachers graduate, well-skilled from college, they
usually will go where the job is going to be the most lucrative. And I
think we are losing a lot of prepared people to the private industry
right away because they can start making more than a seasoned teacher in
that industry. And are we doing anything to try to see how we can level
this?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.2.0"></span>
<p>Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, if the gentle woman will lead-maybe we could they
answer that on the second round of questions? I really want to know what
they think about bring youth, having them build in program.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.3.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>We have been
approaching it in two different ways. One is a formalized way through
course work. <span style="font-style:italic;">We </span>have computer
science classes that not only deal with programming in C-plus-plus, but
they also deal with rebuilding computers, building computer networks.
One of our partnerships is with Cisco. So, that we actually teach Cisco
classes.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.4.0"></span>
<p>People will come out as certified Cisco. We are exploring the same
thing with AAA certification and have Microsoft approaching us for the
same kind of thing. So that when students graduate from high school,
they graduate with those certifications.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.5.0"></span>
<p>Ms. Woolsey. Because I am going to run out of time, and you are
answering my questions, and I am feeling good about what you are doing.
I would like to ask the two gentlemen, what do you think about
bringing—we are talking about teachers not liking technology. Guess
what? Most elementary teachers and most teachers in general are female.
How are we going to break this circle, okay<span
style="font-style:italic;">? </span></p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.6.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. Well, I strongly support what I believe you said earlier
about starting early in the pipeline. If we start at college or even
high school, we have probably missed the boat already.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.7.0"></span>
<p>Ms. WOOLSEY. Yes.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.8.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. We need to get the grade school girls enthusiastic, get
them going, as I believe was said, or staying in the track of
information technology, mathematical skills, quantitative skills. We
need to find computer games that are not boring to little girls so that
they will be brought in.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.9.0"></span>
<p>Ms. WOOLSEY. There you go. Mr. STRAWN. That probably emphasize
language and other types of things which girls have a natural advantage
in over most boys. And I think the Web offers a good chance of that,
since there are many language-related skills and artistic activities
which also girls have very, very strong traditions of strength in. I
think we can do it, if we start early enough. Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank
you.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA64.w.1.10.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. I do not have a great deal to add to the fine comments
that were made. I would just reinforce the fact that the Web is offering
a range of choice to engage students of all backgrounds, genders,
interests in ways that had not been previously available in the box at
the store where the software was wrapped. I am not</p>

<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. That means we are going to be voting. We have 15
minutes before we vote. But you know, apropos of what has been stated, I
talked to some of the teachers in Montgomery County Schools. And, you
know, I said, what is it that you need? Obviously you know some of the
answers. But one of the points that was brought out is that when we have
problems with our computers, we have nobody on hand to repair them.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.7.0"></span>
<p>We have to call a company. We have to wait for them to come out. If
we could just have some internal mechanism where somebody knows how to
repair it right, who is right there. Dr. Glowa,</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.8.0"></span>
<p>heard that or do we have something that addresses that concern?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.9.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. It is the same point that Dr. Fallon was talking about, in
terms of technological support for computers. We have, at the secondary
level, a User Support Specialist in every school, which is a person</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.10.0"></span>
<p>Chairwoman MORELLA. You have somebody in every school?</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA65.w.3.11.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. At the secondary level, we have a User Support Specialist
in every school. At the elementary, as we are building out the global
access, we are trying to build that support in. But it is one User
Support Specialist for every five schools. So, building in that, what we
call a part of our infrastructure, to support the equipment in the
buildings is absolutely essential, and it is a great frustration.</p>

of votes. So, we will adjourn the joint Subcommittees. And we would like
to ask you, if we could, also submit some questions to you, if members
have questions for you to respond. .</p>

<p>WU Dr. Strawn, as you alluded to, school teachers have all of the
time in the world from midnight until 6:00 a.m. to bone-up on
technology. It has been found in the private sector that just grabbing
at some numbers, that it cost $5,000 to put a computer, and software,
and the wiring on a desk. It may cost $35,000 to get folks adequately
trained-up and really get the full benefit from that tech</p>

<p>It is my impression that the same phenomenon occurs in the classroom
for teachers. H.R. 2417, the Education Technology Extension Act, would
establish an extension service to provide assistance to K-12 teachers
and schools to integrate their existing educational technologies into
their curriculum, as well as providing advice on new education
technologies.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.1.0"></span>
<p>This is modeled on the successful Agricultural Extension Programs,
and the successful Manufacturing Extension Programs to help with
manufacturing technologies. I might add that the proposed Education
Technology Extension Program is voluntary. A school district would
participate or not, depending on their perceived needs. I would like the
panel to have a chance to comment on this proposed program, before we
have to dash off and vote.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.2.0"></span>
<p>Mr. STRAWN. I am not only a believer in that idea, I am also a former
practitioner in my previous life at Research University. I attempted to
put together, and did put together, and operated a facility much like
that to help assist public education in our State. So, I have seen it
work. I think it can work, and NSF would be happy to work with you to
pursue that interesting and important idea.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.3.0"></span>
<p>Mr. SPOON. The idea has a lot of appeal to me. I would urge that
there be an element of mobility built into it, given the distances of
schools strewn about districts and states, and that staffing in those
kinds of clearing houses is plugged into classroom experience directly,
carrying ideas from place-to-place, experience from place-toplace with
the credibility of having been in the classroom, as opposed to being an
administrative help desk at a distance, you know, offering opinions from
on high.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.4.0"></span>
<p>Dr. GLOWA. Having that kind of support for school districts that do
not have an internal capacity would be wonderful, I would have to echo.
One of the things we have not talked about here is what needs to happen
in the curriculum to support technology. And that is absolutely
core.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.5.0"></span>
<p>If your curriculum documents and assessments do not support the use
of technology, teaching people to use what is not part of the curriculum
is not beneficial. So, any kind of advisory group needs to keep that in
mind and have that experience.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.6.0"></span>
<p>Dr. FALLON. I need to, or I do not need to, but I certainly would
concur in terms of the comments just made by my colleague, to the right,
in terms of the entire issue of curriculum. If we are not integrating
technology in the curriculum, et cetera, then we are not succeeding in
doing what we should be doing. That is just the beginning, in terms of
now.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.7.0"></span>
<p>We are not there yet, very honestly. I think it is going to be a
couple of years before. The other issue that we have, in terms of
curriculum, I just share this with you, is our teachers are beginning
more and more to use the Internet, in terms of their lesson plans, et
cetera.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.8.0"></span>
<p>That, as we all know, is additional time to their very busy schedule.
And you have heard from all of us here on this particular panel, that
time is probably one of the most important things, as it is for everyone
in every particular position that they have.</p>
<span id="content-0030.xml#GBS.PA66.w.2.9.0"></span>
<p>Mr. Wu. And on that note, I would like to thank the panelists for
their time, and yield back the balance of my time, Madam Chairwoman.</p>

It is interesting our last note on the curriculum, which I would think
<span style="font-style:italic;">I </span>would like to explore at some

<p>As the United States transforms itself into a rapidly changing
information<br />
and knowledge based economy, it is natural to want to make our
children<br />
"technologically savvy" as early as possible to give them a competitive
edge<br />
in life. Not surprisingly, Internet use in the classroom is
growing<br />
exponentially. A recent study done by the Dept. of Education found
that<br />
51% of American classrooms had Internet connections last year.<br />

<p>In the midst of the recent push to incorporate more and more
technology into curriculums, it is important to examine the effects of
high technology on learning. I have heard the complaint in my district
that while schools are using more and more learning technology, most use
it to automate learning rather than bring students unique learning
opportunities.</p>

<p>Overview<br />
Technology availability is improving. During the<br />
last year, the number of computers in American<br />
schools increased 15 percent to create an<br />
installed huse of 6 million computers. While<br />
the increase is encouraging, it is important to<br />
note that the technology available outside<br />
school walls is ofen several generations ahcad<br />
of the technology available inside school walls.<br />
For example, il 11:1, che studentocomputer<br />
ratio for "rop of the line" machincs is twice as<br />
high as the national average sandent-e-comput-<br />
en rato for less sophisticated machines.<br />
</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA75.w.6.1.0"></span>
<p>However, more sciwoks than ever before are corinected to the
Internet. In three years, from the fall of 1994 to the fall of 1997, che
percent age of U.S. public schools wi:h Internet access increased from
$5 percent to 78 percent." The number of schools with five or morc
classrcoms with Internet access increased from 25 percent of all schools
in the fall of 1996 to 43 percent of all schowls in the fall of 1997:
During 1997 and 1998, schools spen: an average of $30.98 per student on
Internet services and are expected to increase that spending</p>

<p>so. In a recent study, the U.S. Department of Labor identifies the 54
jobs with the highese growth potential between now and the year 2005 and
only eight do not require technologi cal fluency. None of the cight
currently pays more than twice the minimum wage.** Moreover, it is
estimated that 60 percent of the jobs available at the beginning of the
next cenarry will require skills currently held by only 20 percent of
the workforce.“ In addition, the demand for workers to fill higher
skilled informacion technology jobs is likely to grow from 874,000 in
1996 to 1.8 million in 2006.* Finally, higher skill jobs have higher
wages. Overall, compensacion in elite jobs grew 2.5 times faster than
compensation in blue-collar occupations, and 4.3 times faster than in
service occupations between 1987 and 1996.</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA78.w.7.1.0"></span>
<p>More than ever before, employers in all industries are demanding that
their employees have basic technology skills and skills enabled by the
use of technology. As far back as 1991, the Secretary of Labor's
Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) articulated five areas
(see sidebar) in which students must be competent, and therefore schools
must reach, for the future.* Today, the skills most often called for are
essentially the sarac: that studenus are cechnologically flueny, that
they learn how to learn, and that they can use technology to
communicate, collaborate, and support cridcal thinking and creative
problem solving.*</p>

<p>Future Teachers Better preparing teachers is not a challenge that
begins with the teachers already in the classroom; it begins earlier.
Over the next decade, K-12 schools are likely to hire roughly two
million new teachers" in part to fill vacancies left by retiring
teachers and in part to accommodate an increase in the student
population. Nevertheless, America's schools of education have only just
begun to focus on preparing their studears — these future teachers
wunderstand, access, and bring technology based experiences into the
learning process. For example, most student teachen enrolled in
education programs in the U.S. neither routinely use technology during
field experience nor work under master teachers and supervi sons who can
advise them on the use of information technology:</p>

<p>Pre-Service Programs Definition: The professional preparation of
teachers has traditionally occurred through four or five-year programs
administered by cot leges of education at instiwtions of higher
education. These programs typically integrate the stucty of subject
matter, student development, and teaching methods. They usually also
include a supervised clinical cxperience often referred to as "studem
teaching – where aspiring teachers work in K-12 clase rooms under the
guidance and supervision of experienced teachers. Teacher preparation
pro grams generally are accredited by the National Council for
Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the national professional
accrediting organization.</p>

Bachnology leaders, Louise Archer's educa. tion technology plan evolves

administrators and the in-house computer expert Es teacher and student
know edge, needs, and comfort increases. Young, a former tracher at the
school, reports that until recently, even some of the teachers in this
technology rich school viewed technology as inevitable, as something
they had to accept. Now, he says teachers are beginning to see the
possibilities for themselves. "Our goal is to create an envt. ronment
that encourages teachers to explore, leam, and deternine what's best for
them and their students in any given circumstance. We want our teach ers
to know enough about using technology that they can take the lead in
determining whether when, and how to ir corporate it as they werk to

development to be optional. Consequenůy,<br />
many dedicated educators sacrifice their per-<br />
sonal time to learn about technology. While<br />
teachers should always share responsibility for<br />
their own professional developmen, primarily<br />
relying on teacher personal time will never<br />
enable a culture of effective technology use.<br />
Self-directed training should supplement, not<br />

<p>Meeting Individual Teacher Needs: The Teacher Technology Adoption
Process To be effective, professional development programs need to
accommoodate the programa goals of the institution, the targeted results
for students, the level of sophistication of teachers who participate,
and the technology available. Since teachers are the linchpins of
success for students, their individual requirements for mastering new
methods, knowledge, and techniques deserve particular attention.</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.3.0"></span>
<p>Experience suggests that teachers, even those most enthusiasuc about
teaching with technolon gy, typically pass through several disunct
stages before they becomc education technology integrators and
innovators. Progression through stages of technology adoption and
integration is not unique to the education community." For decades,
corporate America has witnessed a sim</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.4.0"></span>
<p>progression as businesses have increased the presence and use of
technology, first for internal</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA84.w.3.5.0"></span>
<p>I operations and then for interactions with vendors and customers
Corporate researchers also have identified a cycle of technology
integration that progresses through planning, investigacion, and
experimentation stages to the emergence of new work and organization
models.* Though not identical to the stages of teacher technology
adoption described here, they are similar enough to suggest that
technology integration, ao matter where it occurs, is a process that
evolves over time.</p>

<p>Technology: A Professional Development Tool for Technology
Professionals Al Lucent Technologies, keeping a dispersed team of
professionals current on the technologies they service is a formidable
challenge. To meet the challenge, the company created the Call Center
Institute (CCI), an online resource center and knowledge warehouse
accessible at any time, from anywhere. The CCI is home to more than 800
megabytes of information on current call center technolo gies and
applications in the form of case studies, white papers, research
articles, training materials, presentations, demonstrations and
performance support tools. Not only can Call Center Specialists access
the vast array of infor. mation through CCI; they can access each other.
Whether sharing ideas, experiences, or best practices, the CCI's Infor.
mal chat rooms, synchronous interactive teleconferencing programs,
web-based seminars, and "telecollaboration consultations" with product
engineers help this worldwide team stay current and connected. For more

<p>1 Setting Goals and Meeting them Diane Hathaway, Principal of
Philadelphia's Hi-Freedman Middle Schoul, knew that making her school
"Target Tech" would require clear objectives and hard kort. The school
lacked bott, a computer cluster and a computer teacher. She would have
to serve simutaneously as principai, com. puter teacher, and repair
woman. Nevertheless, under Hathaway's guidance, "mini-clusters of leas:
six compute's and to printers were located in every instructional
classroom. All school personnel trom teachers to custodians meceived
training a: the district training center. Over a period of a year and a
half, every available inservice day was devoted to technology training.
To ensure that teachers used their training. Hathaway decided to accepe
lesson plans only by email. posted caily ar..nounce menos cactusively on
the Internet, and evaluated teaches on their use of technology. www

<p>7 Involving teachers in Planning The technology committee fo: tine
Chitienden South Supervisory District in Hinesburg, Vermont plans and
implements technology use in all district schools. The committee,
composed of fifteen teach. ers and media specialists and an assistant
superintender!, functions as both a de facto decision-making body and a
forum for sharing ir.or. mation among the district's schools. In
addition, the committee's meetings function as informat ir service time
for the members, providing ther, with new knowedge and skills to bring
back to their home schools. There, they serve on local technology
comrait. recs and field suggestions and questions from their colleagues.

<p>4 Faculty First at lowa State towa State University made a conscious
decision to ctegrate lechrology tools into its educationa! Curriculur.
Before teaching stu. dents however, faculty lead to come first. In 1992,
.owa State estab. lished a rentoring program ier undergraduate anc
graduate students to mentor faculty members sonut technology. Ann
Thompson, Director, Center for Technology in Learning and Teaching at
lovit Siale University, says that the program allowed faculty members to
weave technology into projects of interest is a non trcatering way.
Based on lowa Ska:e survey data abolt tac.slty attitudes toward
rechnology, faculty member self-confidence with technology has gown
since the program began. lowa Stale also offers a minor in dua tional
computing through its school 9! education. Enrolment is now a: 150
slurlents, a 100 percent increase in two years. Iowa State works w:17
the University of Virginia and University of Exeter in inglars in the
Coattion to nnoration in Technology and Teacher Education (CITTE). C:ITE
desires visions for appropria:c technology use in the classroom and
produces videcs and demon. strations on the ettective classroom use of
technology. For more infor mation, contac: Ana Thompson,

<p>4 Pyramid to Success Imagine a school where 100 percent of teachers
are voluntarily active in technology training. Does it seem improbable?
It did to Dr. Carol Utay of Jessamine County until she began the "Tag
Team" program at Warner Elementary Schoo., The Tag Team works according
to a sin.ple pyramid scheme. 'nitially, a smali group of teachers was
offered train. ing on the condition that they use their training to
create a technolosy-infused project with a teache? nto nad 1:o:ye: been
"tagged" for training. As new teachers we:0</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA91.w.4.1.0"></span>
<p>agged" they similarly agreed to innlve another teache: in a lech.
rology-infused collaborative projcct. The snussball effect was
impressive. Through the Tag Team program, all teachers at Warner
Elementary are involved in technol. ogy training. Teachers knox that
when they join the tag tean they will be inunlved in authentic projects
a:x that their self-seiected buddy - presumably someone they like
working with will sup. port them through the process. To learn more

<p>Year 2 Summary Overall, the assessment shows that schools are ·
making gains. In fact, schools gained in all four STaR categories. The
number of schook effectively integrating technology increased from 15
percent to 24 percent while the percentage of schools in the Low to Mid
Tech range decreased from 85 percent of schools to 76 percent of
schools. Specifically, the percenage of Target Tech schools doubled from
three to Eix percent while the percentage of High Tech schools increased
by half. Simultaneously, the percentage of Low Tech schools decreased by
five percentage points. Despite auch encouraging progress, more than 75
percest of America's schools remalo in the Mid Tech and Low Tech
categories,</p>

<p>Background In 1997, the CEO Forum established a baseline measure
against which to track the progress of Anerican schools in inte grating
technology and technology use la class. rooms nationwide. This school
technology and readiness assessment, called the Star Assessment, offered
a soapshot of where the nation stood In its effort to integrate
technology in education to improve academic standards and student
achievement. Following up on its commitment to issue an annual update of
the STaR Assessment, this section of this report summarizes the Year 2
STaR Assessment of the CEO Forum. Again this year, the STaR Assessment
is primarity based on hardware and connectivity data collected as part
of a survey of the nation's public schools. The Star Assessment uses the
CEO Forum Star Chart as a backdrop to Hlustrate how our schools are
doing.</p>
<span id="content-0065.xml#GBS.PA93.w.17.1.0"></span>
<p>These trends, and the information on the following pages, indicate
that more students have greater access to better technology than they
did last year. More students have access to multimedia computers and the
instructional rooms at more schools have connections to the Internet.
Although schools continue to make progress in building hardware
infrastructures, commitment to cacher professional develop ment with
technology bags behind. As schools continue to put more connected
computers into classrooms, the CEO Foram hopes chat educa ions and
policymakers will follow the recommendations in this report To make the
most of our radonal investment in education technology, we nust ensure
that teachers are well prepared to guide today's students to future
success</p>

<p>Though educators require professional development and content
resources, they must also be equipped with the tools to enhance leaning
in the next millennium. Providing hardware is a threshold condition upon
which to build new ways of teaching and learning. CONTINUED PROGRESS
TOWARD INSTALLING COMPUTERS IN SCHOOLS • In 1997-1998, schools provided
one computer for every 7.8 students, an increase of 13 percent from
1996-1997.“ • More importantly, in 1997-1998, schools provided one
multi-medla computer to every 12.3 students. This is an improvement of

<p>About this Book - From Google</p>
<p>This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations
on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of
a project to make the world's books discoverable online. It has survived
long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public
domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject to copyright
or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the
public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books are our
gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and
knowledge that's often difficult to discover. Marks, notations and other
marginalia present in the original volume may appear in this file - a
reminder of this book's long journey from the publisher to a library and
finally to you.</p>
<p>Google Book Search has digitized millions of physical books and made
them available online at the Google Books web site. The digitization at
the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books. To
make this book available as an ePub formated file we have taken those
page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition
(or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page images
is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books' pages,
fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the
extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the
ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to
extracted-text based books. Our computer algorithms also have to
automatically determine the structure of the book (what are the headers
and footers, where images are placed, whether text is verse or prose,
and so forth). Getting this right allows us to render the book in a way
that follows the format of the original book.</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes, garbage
characters, extraneous images, or missing pages in this book. Based on
our estimates, these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the
content of the book. The technical challenges of automatically
constructing a perfect book are daunting, but we continue to make
enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies.</p>
<p>We hope you'll enjoy these books as much as we do.</p>
<p>Usage guidelines</p>
<p>Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain
materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to
the public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work
is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken
steps to prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing
technical restrictions on automated querying.</p>
<p>We also ask that you:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Make non-commercial use of the files:</em> We designed Google
Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these
files for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li><em>Refrain from automated querying:</em> Do not send automated
queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research
on machine translation, optical character recognition or other areas
where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We
encourage the use of public domain materials for these purposes and may
be able to help.</li>
<li><em>Maintain attribution:</em> The Google "watermark" you see on
each file is essential for informing people about this project and
helping them find additional materials through Google Book Search.
Please do not remove it.</li>
<li><em>Keep it legal:</em> Whatever your use, remember that you are
responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume
that just because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in
the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users
in other countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from
country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific
use of any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's
appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite
severe.</li>
</ul>
<p>About Google Book Search</p>
<p>Google's mission is to organize the world's information and to make
it universally accessible and useful. Google Book Search helps readers
discover the world's books while helping authors and publishers reach
new audiences.</p>
